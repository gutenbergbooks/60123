<div><span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span><h1>CHAPTER I</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HERE</span> is a letter for you, monsieur,” said the
concierge of the Hôtel du Soleil et de l’Ecosse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a shabby concierge sharing in the
tarnish of the shabby hotel which (for the information
of those fortunate ones who only know of the
Ritz, and the Meurice and other such-like palaces)
is situated in the unaristocratic neighbourhood of the
Halles Centrales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it bears the Paris postmark, it must be the
one which monsieur was expecting,” said he, detaching
it from the clip on the keyboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are perfectly right,” said Martin Overshaw.
“I recognise the handwriting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Englishman sat on the worn cane seat
in the little vestibule and read his letter. It ran:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'><span class='sc'>Dear Martin</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’ve been away. Otherwise I should have answered
your note sooner. I’m delighted you’re in this God-forsaken
city, but what brought you here in August,
Heaven only knows. We must meet at once. I can’t
ask you to my abode, because I’ve only one room, one
chair and a bed, and you would be shocked to sit
on the chair while I sat on the bed, or to sit on the
bed while I sat on the chair. And I couldn’t offer
you anything but a cigarette (<span class='it'>caporal, à quatre sous
le paquet</span>) and the fag end of a bottle of grenadine
syrup and water. So let us dine together at the place
where I take such meals as I can afford. <span class='it'>Au Petit
Cornichon</span>, or as the snob of a proprietor yearns to
call it, The “Restaurant Dufour.” It’s a beast of a
hole in the Rue Baret off the Rue Bonaparte; but I
don’t think either of us could run to the Café de Paris
or Paillard’s and we’ll have it all to ourselves. Meet
me there at seven.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;'>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Corinna Hastings</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Overshaw rose and addressed the concierge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is the Rue Bonaparte?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The concierge informed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to dine with a lady at a restaurant
called the Petit Cornichon. Do you think I had better
wear evening dress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The concierge was perplexed. The majority of
the British frequenters of the hotel, when they did not
dine in gangs at the table d’hôte, went out to dinner
in flannels or knickerbockers, and wore cloth caps,
and looked upon the language of the country as an
incomprehensible joke. But here was a young Englishman
of a puzzling type who spoke perfect French
with a strange purity of accent, in spite of his abysmal
ignorance of Paris, and talked about dressing for
dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will ask Monsieur Bocardon,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Bocardon, the manager, a fat, greasy
Provençal, who sat over a ledger in the cramped
bureau, leaned back in his chair and threw out his
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evening dress in a little restaurant of the <span class='it'>quartier</span>.
<span class='it'>Mais non!</span> They would look at you through the
windows. There would be a crowd. It would be an
affair of the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Overshaw smiled. “Merci, monsieur,” said
he. “But as you may have already guessed, I am
new to Paris and Paris ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That doesn’t matter,” replied Monsieur Bocardon
graciously. “Paris isn’t France. We of the south—I
am from Nîmes—care that for Paris——” he
snapped his fingers. “Monsieur knows the Midi?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my first visit to France,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais comment donc?</span> You speak French like a
Frenchman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother was a Swiss,” replied Martin ingenuously.
“And I lived all my boyhood in Switzerland—in
the Canton de Vaud. French is my mother
tongue, and I have been teaching it in England ever
since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha! Monsieur is <span class='it'>professeur</span>?” Monsieur Bocardon
asked politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, <span class='it'>professeur</span>,” said Martin, conscious for the
first time in his life of the absurd dignity of the
French title. It appealed to a latent sense of humour
and he smiled wryly. Yes. He was a Professor—had
been for the last ten years, at Margett’s Universal
College, Hickney Heath; a professor engaged in cramming
large classes of tradesmen’s children, both
youths and maidens, with such tricksters’ command of
French grammar and vocabulary as would enable them
to obtain high marks in the stereotyped examinations
for humble positions in the Public and semi-public
services. He had reduced the necessary instruction
to an exact science. He had carried hundreds of
pupils through their examinations with flying colours;
but he had never taught a single human being to
speak thirty consecutive coherent words of French
or to read and enjoy a French book. When he was
very young and foolish he had tried to teach them
the French speech as a living, organic mode of communication
between human beings, with the result
that his pupils soul-strung for examinations had revolted
and the great Cyrus Margett, founder of the
colossal and horrible Strasbourg goose factory known
as Margett’s Universal College, threatened to sack
him if he persisted in such damnable and unprofitable
imbecility. So, being poor and unenterprising and
having no reason to care whether a Mr. James Bagshawe
or a Miss Susan Tulliver profited for more
than the examination moment by his teaching, he
had taught the dry examination-bones of the French
language for ten years. And—“<span class='it'>Monsieur est professeur</span>,”
from Monsieur Bocardon!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as he turned away and began to mount the
dingy stairs that led to his bedroom, it struck him
that he was now only a professor <span class='it'>in partibus</span>. He
was no longer a member of the professorial staff of
Margett’s Universal College. The vast, original Margett
had retired with fortune, liver and head deservedly
swollen to county magnateship, leaving, for
pecuniary considerations, the tremendous educational
institution to a young successor, who having adopted
as his watchword the comforting shibboleth, “efficiency,”
had dismissed all those professors who did
not attain his standard of slickness. Martin Overshaw
was not slick. The young apostle of efficiency
had dismissed Martin Overshaw at a month’s notice,
after ten years service. It was as though a practised
<span class='it'>gougeur</span> or hand gorger of geese had been judged
obsolescent and made to give place to one who gorged
them by Hertzian rays. The new Olympian had
flashed a glance, a couple of lightning questions at
Martin and that was the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, Martin Overshaw did not emanate efficiency
like the eagle-faced men in the illustrated advertisements
who undertake to teach you how to become
a millionaire in a fortnight. He was of mild
and modest demeanour; of somewhat shy and self-depreciatory
attitude; a negligible personality in any
assemblage of human beings; a man (according to the
blasphemous saying) of no account. Of medium
height, thin, black-haired, of sallow complexion, he
regarded the world unspeculatively out of clear
grey eyes, that had grown rather tired. As he brushed
his hair before the long strip of wardrobe mirror,
it did not occur to him to criticise his reflected image.
He made no claims to impeccability of costume. His
linen and person were scrupulously clean; his sober
suit comparatively new. But his appearance, though
he knew it not, suffered from a masculine dowdiness,
indefinable, yet obvious. His ill-tied cravat had an
inveterate quarrel with his ill-chosen collar and left
the collar stud exposed, and innocent of sumptuary
crime he allowed his socks to ruck over his ankles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Once he had grown a full black beard, full in
the barber’s sense, but dejectedly straggling to the
commonplace eye of a landlady’s daughter who had
goaded him into a tepid flirtation. To please the
nymph long since married to a virtuous plumber whom
Martin himself had called in to make his bath a going
concern, he had divested himself of the offending
excrement and contented himself thenceforward
with a poor little undistinguished moustache. A very
ordinary, unarresting young man was Martin Overshaw.
Yet, in his simple, apologetic way—<span class='it'>exempli
gratia</span>, when he smiled with deferential confidence on
the shabby concierge and the greasy Monsieur Bocardon—he
carried with him an air of good-breeding,
a disarming, sensitiveness of manner which commanded
the respect, contemptuous though it might
have sometimes been, of coarser natures. A long,
thin, straight nose with delicate nostrils, the only
noticeable feature of his face, may have had something
to do with this impression of refinement. Much
might be written on noses. The Great Master of
Noseology, Lawrence Sterne, did but broach the subject.
On account, perhaps, of a long head terminating
in a long blunt chin, and a mild patience of expression,
he bore at Margett’s Universal College the
traditional sobriquet of “Cab-horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cab-horse, however, was now turned out to
grass—in August Paris. He had been there three
days and his head swam with the wonder of it. As
he walked along the indicated route to the Petit
Cornichon in the airless dark, he felt the thrill of
freedom and of romance. Down the Boulevard Sébastopol
he went, past the Tour Saint Jacques, through
the Place du Châtelet over the Pont au Change and
across the Île de la Cité to the Boulevard Saint Michel,
and turned to the right along the Boulevard Saint
Germain until he came to the Rue Bonaparte and his
destination. It was the sweltering cool of the evening.
Paris sat out of doors, at cafés, at gateways in
shirt sleeves and loosened bodices, at shop fronts, at
dusty tables before humble restaurants. Pedestrians
walked languidly in quest of ultimate seats. In the
wide thoroughfares the omnibuses went their accustomed
route; but motor-cabs whizzed unfrequent for
lack of custom—they who could afford to ride in taxi-autos
on the <span class='it'>rive gauche</span> were far away in cooler
regions—and the old horses of crawling fiacres
hung stagnant heads. Only the stale dregs of Paris
remained in the Boul’ Mich. Yet it was Fairyland
to the emancipated professor <span class='it'>in partibus</span> who paused
here and there to catch the odd phrases of his
mother tongue which struck his ears with delicious
unfamiliarity. Paris, too, that close, sultry
evening, smelled of unutterable things; but
to Martin Overshaw it was the aroma of a Wonder
City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found without difficulty the Café-Restaurant
Dufour whose gilded style and title eclipsed the modest
sign of the “Petit Cornichon” prudently allowed
to remain in porcelain letters on the glass of door
and windows. Under the ægis, as it were, of the
poor “little gherkin” and independent of the magnificent
Dufour establishment, was the announcement
displayed: “<span class='it'>Déjeuners 1 fr. 50. Dîners 2 fr. Vin
Compris.</span>” The ground floor was a small café, newly
decorated with fresco panels of generously unclad
ladies dropping roses on goat-legged gentlemen: symptoms
of the progressive mind of the ambitious Monsieur
Dufour. Only two tables were occupied—by
ruddy-faced provincials engaged over coffee and dominoes.
To Martin, standing embarrassed, came a pallid
waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Monsieur désire?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Le Restaurant.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est en haut, monsieur, Au premier.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed to a meagre staircase on the left-hand
side. Martin ascended and found himself alone in
a ghostly-tabled room. From a doorway emerged
another pallid waiter, who also addressed him with
the enquiry: “<span class='it'>Monsieur désire?</span>”—but the enquiry
was modulated with a certain subtle inflection of surprise
and curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am expecting a lady,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bien, monsieur.</span> A table for two? <span class='it'>Voici.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew back an inviting chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like this one by the window,” said Martin.
The room being on the entresol, the ceiling was
low and the place reeked with reproachful reminders
of long-forgotten one-franc-fifty and two-franc
meals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry, Monsieur,” replied the waiter, “but
this table is reserved by a lady who takes here all
her repasts. Monsieur can see that it is so by the
half-finished bottle of mineral water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held up the bottle of Evian in token of his
veracity. Scrawled in pencil across the label ran the
inscription, “Mlle. Hastings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle Hastings!” cried Martin. “Why,
that is the lady I am expecting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter smiled copiously. Monsieur was a
friend of Miss Hastings? Then it was a different
matter. Mademoiselle said she would be back to-night
and that was why her bottle of Evian had been
preserved for her. She was the only one left of the
enormous clientèle of the restaurant. It was a restaurant
of students. In the students’ season, not a
table for the chance comer. All engaged. The students
paid so much per week or per month for nourishment.
It really was a pension, <span class='it'>enfin</span>, for board
without lodging. When the students were away
from Paris the restaurant was kept open at a loss;
not a very great loss, for in Paris one knew how
to accommodate oneself to circumstance. Good
provincials and English tourists sometimes wandered
in. One always then indicated the decorations,
real masterpieces some of them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Only
a day or two ago an American traveller had taken
photographs. If Monsieur would deign to look
round .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin deigned. Drawings in charcoal and crayon
on the distempered walls, caricatures, bold nudes,
bars of music, bits of satiric verse, flowing signatures,
bore evidence of the passage of many generations
of students.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It amuses them,” said the waiter, “and gives the
place a character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was pointing out the masterpieces when a
young voice by the door sang out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin turned and met the welcoming eyes of
Corinna Hastings, fair-haired, slender, neatly dressed
in blue serge coat and skirt and a cheap little hat to
which a long pheasant’s feather gave a touch of
bravado.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a real Godsend,” she declared. “I was
thinking of throwing myself into the river, only there
would have been no one on the deserted bridge to
fish me out again. I am the last creature left in
Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am more than lucky then to find you, Corinna,”
said Martin. “For you’re the only person in Paris
that I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you find my address?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went down to Wendlebury——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you saw them all?” said Corinna, as they
took their seats at the window-table. “Father and
mother and Bessie and Joan and Ada, etcetera, etcetera
down to the new baby. The new baby makes ten of
us alive—really he’s the fourteenth. I wonder how
many more there are going to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t think there would be any more,” replied
Martin gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth can you know about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The satirical challenge brought a flush to Martin’s
sallow cheek. What did he know in fact of the very
intimate concerns of the Reverend Thomas Hastings
and his wife?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid they find it hard to make both ends
meet, as it is,” he explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet I suppose they all flourish as usual—playing
tennis and golf and selling at bazaars and quarrelling
over curates?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They all seem pretty happy,” said Martin, not
overpleased at his companion’s airy treatment of her
family. He, himself, the loneliest of men, had found
grateful warmth among the noisy, good-hearted crew
of girls. It hurt him to hear them contemptuously
spoken of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the first time you went down since——!”
she paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since my mother died? Yes. She died early in
May, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be a terrible loss to you,” said Corinna
in a softened voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded and looked out of window at the houses
opposite. That was why he was in Paris. For the
last ten years, ever since his father’s death had hurried
him away from Cambridge, after a term or two,
into the wide world of struggle for a living, he had
spent all his days of freedom in the little Kentish
town. And these days were few. There were no
long luxurious vacations at Margett’s Universal College,
such as there are at ordinary colleges and schools.
The grind went on all the year round, and the staff
had but scanty holidays. Such as they were he passed
them at his mother’s tiny villa. His father had given
up the chaplaincy in Switzerland, where he had married
and where Martin had been born, to become
Vicar of Wendlebury, and Mr. Hastings was his successor.
Mrs. Overshaw, with her phlegmatic temperament,
had taken root in Wendlebury and there
Martin had visited her and there he had been received
into the intimacy of the Hastings family and
there she had died; and now that the little villa was
empty and Martin had no place outside London to
lay his leisured head, he had satisfied the dream of
his life and come to Paris. But even in this satisfaction
there was pain. What was Paris compared
with the kind touch of that vanished hand? He
sighed. He was a simple soul in spite of his thirty
years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter roused him from his sad reflections
by bringing the soup and a bottle of thin red wine.
Conscious of food and drink and a female companion
of prepossessing exterior, Martin’s face brightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so jolly of them in Paris to throw in wine
like this,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only hope you can drink the stuff,” remarked
Corinna. “We call it <span class='it'>tord-boyau</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a rare treat,” said Martin. “I can’t afford
wine in England, and the soup is delicious. Somehow
no English landlady ever thinks of making
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England is a beast of a place,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet in your letter you called Paris a God-forsaken
city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is in August. The schools are closed. Not
a studio is open. Every single student has cleared
out and there’s nothing in the world to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve found heaps to do,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Pantheon and Notre Dame and the Folies
Bergère,” said Corinna. “There’s also the Eiffel
Tower. Imagine a three years’ art-student finding
fun on the Eiffel Tower!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why haven’t you gone home this August as
usual?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna knitted her brows. “That’s another story,”
she replied shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon. I didn’t mean to be impertinent,”
said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “Don’t be silly—you think wallowing
in the family trough is the height of bliss. It
isn’t. I would sooner starve than go back. At any
rate I should be myself, a separate entity, an individual.
Oh, that being merely a bit of clotted family!
How I should hate it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you would return to Paris in the autumn,”
said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she frowned and broke her bread impatiently.
All that was another story. “But never mind about
me. Tell me about yourself, Martin. Perhaps we
may fix up something merry to do together. Père
la Chaise or the Tomb of Napoleon. How long are
you staying in Paris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can only afford a week—I’ve already had three
days. I must look out for another billet as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another billet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her question reminded him that she was ignorant
of his novel position as professor <span class='it'>in partibus</span>. He
explained, over the <span class='it'>bœuf flammande</span>. Corinna putting
the “other story” of her own trouble aside listened
sympathetically. All Paris art-students must learn
to do that; otherwise who would listen sympathetically
to them? And all art-students want a prodigious
amount of sympathy, so uniquely constituted is each
in genius and temperament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t go back to that dog’s life,” she said,
after a while. “You must get a post in a good public-school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin sighed. “Why not in the Kingdom of
Heaven? It’s just as possible. Heads of Public
Schools don’t engage as masters men who haven’t
a degree and have hacked out their youth in low-class
institutions like Margett’s. I know only too
well. To have been at Margett’s damns me utterly
with the public-schools. I must find another Margett’s!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you do something else?” asked the
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else in the world can I do? You know very
well what happened to me. My poor old father was
just able to send me to Cambridge because I had a
good scholarship. When he died there was nothing
to supplement the scholarship which wasn’t enough
to keep me at the University. I had to go down. My
mother had nothing but my father’s life insurance
money—a thousand pounds—and twenty pounds a
year from the Freemasons. When she wrote to her
relations about her distress, what do you think my
damned set of Swiss uncles and aunts and cousins
sent her? Two hundred francs! Eight pounds! And
they’re all rolling in money got out of the English.
I had to find work at once to support us both. My
only equipment was a knowledge of French. I got
a post at Margett’s through a scholastic agency. I
thought it a miracle. When the letter came accepting
my application I didn’t sleep all night. I remained
there till a week or so ago, working twelve hours a
day all the year round. I don’t say I had classes for
twelve hours,” he admitted, conscientiously, “but when
you see about a couple of hundred pupils a day and
they all do written work which needs correcting, you’ll
find you have as much work in class as out of class.
Last night I dreamed I was confronted with a pile of
exercise books eight feet high.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a dog’s life,” Corinna repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” said Martin. “<span class='it'>Mais que veux-tu, ma pauvre
Corinne.</span> I detest it as much as one can detest anything.
If even I was a successful teacher—<span class='it'>passe
encore</span>. But I doubt whether I have taught anybody
even the <span class='it'>régime du participe passé</span> save as a mathematical
formula. It’s heart-rending. It has turned
me into a brainless, soulless, heartless, bloodless machine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment or two the glamour of the Parisian
meal faded away. He beheld himself—as he had wofully
done in intervals between the raptures of the
past few days—an anxious and despairing young
man: terribly anxious to obtain another abhorred
teachership, yet desperate at the prospect of lifelong,
ineffectual drudgery. Corinna, her elbows on the
table, poising in her hand a teaspoonful of tepid strawberry
ice, regarded him earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I were a man,” she declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swallowed the morsel of ice and dropped her
spoon with a clatter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would take life by the throat and choke something
big out of it,” she cried dramatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably an ocean of tears or a Sahara of despair,”
said a voice from the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both turned sharply. The speaker was a middle-aged
man of a presence at once commanding and
subservient. He had a shock of greyish hair brushed
back from the forehead and terminating above the
collar in a fashion suggestive of the late Abbé Liszt.
His clean-shaven face was broad and massive; the
features large: eyes grey and prominent; the mouth
loose and fleshy. Many lines marked it, most noticeable
of all a deep, vertical furrow between the brows.
He was dressed, somewhat shabbily, in a black frock
coat suit and wore the white tie of the French attorney.
His voice was curiously musical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord, Fortinbras, how you startled me!”
exclaimed Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t help it,” said he, coming forward.
“When you turn the Petit Cornichon into the stage of
the Odéon, what can I do but give you the reply?
I came here to find our good friend Widdrington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Widdrington went back to England this morning,”
she announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a pity. I had good news for him. I have
arranged his little affair. He should be here to profit
by it. I love impulsiveness in youth,” he said addressing
himself to Martin, “when it proceeds from noble
ardour; but when it marks the feather-headed irresponsibility
of the idiot, I cannot deprecate it too
strongly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Challenged, as it were, for a response, “I cordially
agree with you, sir,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You two ought to know one another,” said
Corinna. “This is my friend, Mr. Overshaw—Martin,
let me introduce you to Mr. Daniel Fortinbras,
<span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras extended a soft white hand and holding
Martin’s benevolently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which being translated into our rougher speech,”
said he, “means Dealer in Happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would provide me with some,” said
Martin, laughingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so do I,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras drew a chair to the table and sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My fee,” said he, “is five francs each, paid in
advance.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span><span class='sc'>T</span> this unexpected announcement Martin exchanged
a swift glance with Corinna. She
smiled, drew a five franc piece from her purse
and laid it on the table. Martin, wondering, did the
same. The Marchand de Bonheur unbuttoned his
frock coat and slipped the coins, with a professional
air, into his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Overshaw,” said he, “you must understand,
as our charming friend Corinna Hastings and indeed
half the Quartier Latin understand, that for such
happiness as it may be my good fortune to provide
I do not charge one penny. But having to eke out a
precarious livelihood, I make a fixed charge of five
francs for every consultation, no matter whether it be
for ten minutes or ten hours. And for the matter
of that, ten hours is not my limit. I am at your
service for an indefinite period of time, provided it
be continuous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very good, indeed, of you,” said Martin.
“I hope you’ll join us,” he added, as the waiter approached
with three coffee cups.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I thank you. I have already had my after
dinner coffee. But if I might take the liberty of
ordering something else——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By all means,” said Martin hospitably. “What
will you have? Cognac? Liqueur? Whisky and
soda?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras held up his hand—it was the hand of
a comfortable, drowsy prelate—and smiled. “I have
not touched alcohol for many years. I find it blunts
the delicacy of perception which is essential to a
Marchand de Bonheur in the exercise of his calling.
Auguste will give me a <span class='it'>syrop de framboises à l’eau</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bien, m’sieu</span>,” said Auguste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the other hand, I shall smoke with pleasure
one of your excellent English cigarettes. Thanks.
Allow me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With something of the grand manner he held a
lighted match to Corinna’s cigarette and to Martin’s.
Then he blew it out and lit another for his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A superstition,” said he, by way of apology. “It
arises out of the Russian funeral ritual in which the
three altar candles are lit by the same taper. To apply
the same method of illumination to three worldly
things like cigars or cigarettes is regarded as an act
of impiety and hence as unlucky. For two people to
dip their hands together in the same basin, without
making the sign of the cross in the water, is unlucky
on account of the central incident of the Last Supper,
and to spill the salt as you are absent-mindedly doing,
Corinna, is a violation of the sacred symbol of
sworn friendship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all very interesting,” said Corinna calmly.
“But what are Martin Overshaw and I to do to be
happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras looked from one to the other with benevolent
shrewdness and inhaled a long puff of smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about our young medical student friend,
Camille Fargot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna flushed red—as only pale blondes can
flush. “What do you know about Camille?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything—and nothing. Come, come. It’s my
business to keep a paternal eye on you children.
Where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who the deuce is Camille?” thought Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s at Bordeaux, safe in the arms of his ridiculous
mother,” replied Corinna tartly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good, good,” said Fortinbras. “And you, Mr.
Overshaw, where is the lady on whom you have set
your affections?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin laughed frankly. “Heaven knows. There
isn’t one. The <span class='it'>Princesse lointaine</span>, perhaps, whom I’ve
never seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras again looked from one to the other.
“This complicates matters,” said he. “On the other
hand, perhaps, it simplifies them. There being nothing
common, however, to your respective roads to
happiness, each case must be dealt with separately.
<span class='it'>Place aux dames</span>—Corinna will first expose to me the
sources of her divine discontent. Proceed, Corinna.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drummed with her fingers on the table, and
little wrinkles lined her young forehead. Martin
pushed back his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t I better go for a walk until it is my turn
to be interviewed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna bade him not be silly. Whatever she had
to say he was welcome to hear. It would be better
if he did hear it; then he might appreciate the lesser
misery of his own plight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m an utter, hopeless failure,” she cried with an
air of defiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t paint worth a cent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That old beast Delafosse says I’ll never learn to
draw and I’m colour blind. That’s a brutal way of
putting it; but it’s more or less true. Consequently
I can’t earn my living by painting pictures. No one
would buy them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then they must be very bad indeed,” murmured
Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s it,” said Corinna. “I’m done for. An
old aunt died and left me a legacy of four hundred
pounds. I thought I could best use it by coming to
Paris to study art. I’ve been at it three years, and
I’m as clever as when I began. I have about twenty
pounds left. When it’s gone I shall have to go home
to my smug and chuckling family. There are ten of
us. I’m the eldest and the youngest is three months
old. Pretty fit I should be after three years of Paris
to go back. When I was at home last, if ever I referred
to an essential fact of physiological or social
existence, my good mother called me immodest and
my sisters goggle-eyed and breathless besought me in
corners to tell them all about it. When I tell them
I know people who haven’t gone through the ceremony
of marriage they think I’m giving them a peep
into some awful hell of iniquity. It’s a fearful joy
to them. Then mother says I’m corrupting their
young and innocent minds and father mentions me
at Family prayers. And the way they run after any
young man that happens along is sickening. I’m
a prudish old maid compared with them. Have you
ever seen me running after men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a modern Penthesilea,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway, Wendlebury—that’s my home—would
drive me mad. I’ll have to go away and fend for
myself. Father can’t give me an allowance. It’s
as much as he can do to pay his butcher’s bills. Besides,
I’m not that sort. What I do, I must do on
my own. But I can’t do anything to get a living. I
can’t typewrite, I don’t know shorthand. I can
scarcely sew a button on a camisole, I’m not quite
sure of my multiplication table, I couldn’t add up a
column of pounds, shillings and pence correctly to
save my life, I play the devil with an egg if I put it
into a saucepan and if I attempted to bath a baby
I should drown it. I’m twenty-four years of age and
a helpless, useless failure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras drank some of his raspberry syrup and
water and lit another cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you have still twenty pounds in your pocket?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Corinna, “and I shan’t go home until
I’ve spent the last penny. That’s why I’m in Paris,
drinking its August dregs. I’ve already bought a
third class ticket to London—available for six months—so
I can get back any time without coming down
on my people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That act of pusillanimous prudence,” remarked
Fortinbras, “seems to me to be a flaw in an otherwise
admirable scheme of immediate existence. If
the ravens fed an impossibly unhumorous, and probably
unprepossessing, disagreeable person like Elijah,
surely there are doves who will minister to the sustenance
of an attractive and keen-witted young woman
like yourself. But that is a mere generalisation. I
only wish you,” said he, bending forward and paternally
and delicately touching her hand, “I only
wish you to take heart of grace and not strangle yourself
in your exhaustively drawn up category of incompetence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s manner was so sympathetic, his deep
voice so persuasive, the smile in his eyes so understanding,
the massive, lined face so illuminated by
wise tenderness that his words fell like balm on her
rebellious spirit before their significance, or want of
significance, could be analysed by her intellect. The
intensity of attitude and feature with which her
confession had been attended relaxed into girlish
ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed somewhat self-consciously and took
a cigarette from the packet offered her by a silent and
wondering Martin. She perked up her shapely head
and once more the cock-pheasant’s plume on her cheap
straw hat gave her a pleasant air of braggadocio.
Martin noticed for the first time that she had a little
mutinous nose and a defiant lift of the chin above
a broad white throat. He found it difficult to harmonise
her appearance of confident efficiency with her
lamentable avowal of failure. Those blue eyes somewhat
hard beneath the square brow ought to have
commanded success. Those strong nervous hands
were of just the kind to choke the great things out
of life. He could not suddenly divest himself of
preconceived ideas. To the dull, unaspiring drudge,
Corinna Hastings leading the fabulous existence of
the Paris studios had been invested with such mystery
as surrounded the goddesses of the Gaiety Theatre
and the Headmaster of Eton.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin also reflected that in her litany of woe she
had omitted all reference to the medical student now
in the arms of his ridiculous mother. He began to
feel mildly jealous of this Camille Fargot, who assumed
the shadow shape of a malignant influence.
Yet she did not appear to be the young woman to
tolerate aggressive folly on the part of a commonplace
young man. Fortinbras himself had called her
Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons. He was puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you say is very comforting and exhilarating,
Fortinbras,” remarked Corinna, “but can’t you let
me have something practical?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All in good time, my dear,” replied Fortinbras
serenely. “I have no quack nostrums to hand over at
a minute’s notice. Auguste——” he summoned the
waiter and addressed him in fluent French, marred
by a Britannic accent: “Give me another glass of
this obscene though harmless beverage and satisfy
the needs of Monsieur and Mademoiselle, and after
that leave us in peace, and if any one seeks to penetrate
into this <span class='it'>salle à manger</span>, say that it is engaged
by a Lodge of Freemasons. Here is remuneration
for your prospective zeal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With impressive flourish he deposited fifteen centimes
in the palm of Auguste, who bowed politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Merci, m’sieu</span>,” said he. “<span class='it'>Et monsieur</span>,
dame——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked enquiringly at Martin and Martin looked
enquiringly at Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to blow twenty pounds,” she replied.
“I’ll have a <span class='it'>kummel glacé</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ll have the same,” said Martin, “though I
don’t in the least know what it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter retired. Corinna leaned across the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re thirty years of age and you’ve lived ten
years in London and have never seen kummel served
with crushed ice and straws?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Martin simply. “What is kummel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She regarded him in wonderment. “Have you ever
heard of champagne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More often than I’ve tasted it,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This young man,” remarked Corinna, “has seen
as much of life as a squirrel in a cage. That may
not be very polite, Martin—but you know it’s true.
Can you dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever fired off a gun?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was once in the Cambridge University Rifle
Corps,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You used a rifle, not a gun,” cried Corinna. “Have
you ever shot a bird?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or caught a fish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you play cricket, golf, ride——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bicycle,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s something, anyhow. What do you use it
for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To go backwards and forwards to my work,” said
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do in the way of amusement?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” said Martin, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My good Fortinbras,” said Corinna, “you have
your work cut out for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter brought the drinks, and after enquiring
whether they needed all the electricity, turned out
most of the lights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin always remembered the scene: the little low-ceilinged
room with its grotesque decorations looming
fantastic through the semi-darkness; the noises and
warm smells rising from the narrow street; the eyes
of the girl opposite raised somewhat mockingly to
his, as straw in mouth she bent her head over the
iced kummel; the burly figure and benevolent face of
their queer companion who for five francs had offered
to be the arbiter of his destiny, and leaned forward,
elbow on table and chin in hand, serenely expectant
to hear the inmost secrets of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt tongue-tied and shy and sucking too nervously
at his straw choked himself with the strong
liqueur. It was one thing to unburden himself to
Corinna, another to make coherent statement of his
grievance to a stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am at your disposal, my dear Overshaw,” said
the latter, kindly. “From personal observation and
from your answers to Corinna’s enfilade of questions,
I gather that you are not overwhelmed by any cataclysm
of disaster, but rather that yours is the more
negative tragedy of a starved soul—a poor, starved
soul hungering for love and joy and the fruitfulness
of the earth and the bounty of spiritual things. Your
difficulty now is: How to say to this man, ‘Give me
bread for my soul.’ Am I not right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A glimmer of irony in his smiling grey eyes or
an inflection of it in his persuasive voice would have
destroyed the flattering effect of the little speech.
Martin had never taken his soul into account. The
diagnosis shed a new light on his state of being. The
starvation of his soul was certainly the root of the
trouble; an infinitely more dignified matter than mere
discontent with one’s environment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said he. “You’re right. I’ve had no chance
of development. My own fault perhaps. I’ve not
been strong enough to battle against circumstances.
Circumstances have imprisoned me, as Corinna says,
like a squirrel in a cage, and I’ve spent my time in
going round and round in the profitless wheel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the nature of the wheel?” asked Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever heard of Margett’s Universal College?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” said Fortinbras. “It is one of the many
mind-wrecking institutions of which our beloved country
is so proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to hear you say that,” cried Martin. “I’ve
been helping to wreck minds there for the last ten
years. I’ve taught French. Not the French language;
but examination French. When the son of
a greengrocer wants to get a boy-clerkship in the
Civil Service, it’s essential that he should know that
<span class='it'>bal</span>, <span class='it'>cal</span>, <span class='it'>carnaval</span>, <span class='it'>pal</span>, <span class='it'>regal</span>, <span class='it'>chacal</span> take an ‘s’ in the
plural, in spite of the fact that millions of Frenchmen
go through their lives without once uttering the
plural words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How came you to teach French?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother tongue—my mother was a Swiss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An English chaplain in Switzerland. You see it
was like this——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, started on his course, and helped here
and there by a shrewd and sympathetic question, Martin,
the ingenuous, told his story, while Corinna,
slightly bored, having heard most of it already, occupied
herself by drawing a villainous portrait of
him on the tablecloth. When he mentioned details
unknown to her she paused in her task and raised
her eyes. Like her own, his autobiography was a
catalogue of incompetence, but it held no record of
frustrated ambitions—no record of any ambitious desire
whatever. It shewed the tame ass’s unreflecting
acquiescence in its lot of drudgery. There had been
no passionate craving for things of delight. Why
cry for the moon? With a salary of a hundred and
thirty-five pounds a year out of which he must contribute
to the support of his widowed mother, a man
can purchase for himself but little splendour of existence,
and Martin was not one of those to whom
splendour comes unbought. He had lived, semi-content,
in a fog splendour-obscuring, for the last ten
years. But this evening the fog had lifted. The
glamour of Paris, even the Pantheon and the Eiffel
Tower sarcastically mentioned by Corinna, had helped
to dispel it. So had Corinna’s sisterly interest in his
dull affairs. And so, more than all, had helped the
self-analysis formulated under the compelling power
of the philanthropist with shiny coat-sleeves and
frayed linen, at once priest, lawyer and physician who
had pocketed his five francs fee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He talked long and earnestly; and the more he
talked and the more minutely he revealed the aridity
of his young life, the stronger grew within him a hitherto
unknown spirit of revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all,” he said at last, wiping a streaming
brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And very interesting indeed,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it?” said Corinna. “And he never even
kissed”—so complete had been Martin’s apologia—“the
landlady’s daughter who married the plumber.”
She challenged him with a glance. “I swear you
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a shy twist of his lips Martin confessed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—I did once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not twice?” asked Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, why not?” asked Fortinbras, seeing Martin
hesitate, and his smile was archiepiscopal indulgence.
“Why but one taste of ambrosial lips?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin reddened beneath his olive skin. “I hardly
like to say—it seems so indelicate——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Allons donc</span>” cried Corinna. “We’re in Paris,
not Wendlebury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must get to the bottom of this, my dear Martin—it’s
a privilege I demand from my clients to address
them by their Christian names—otherwise how
can I establish the necessary intimate <span class='it'>rapport</span> between
them and myself? So I repeat, my dear Martin,
we must have the reason for the rupture or the
dissolution or the termination of what seems to be
the only romantic episode in your career. I’m not
joking,” Fortinbras added gravely, after a pause.
“From the psychological point of view, it is important
that I should know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin looked appealingly from one to the other—from
Fortinbras massively serious to Corinna serenely
mocking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A weeny unencouraged plumber?” she suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat bolt upright and gasped. “Good God, no!”
He flushed indignant. “She was a most highly respectable
girl. Nothing of that sort. I wish I hadn’t
mentioned the matter. It’s entirely unimportant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is so,” said Corinna, “why didn’t you kiss
the girl again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you want to know,” replied Martin desperately,
“I have a constitutional horror of the smell
of onions,” and mechanically he sucked through his
straw the tepid residue of melted ice in his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna threw herself back in her chair and
laughed uncontrollably. It was just the lunatic sort
of thing that would happen to poor old Martin. She
knew her sex. Instantaneously she pictured in her
mind the fluffy, lower middle-class young person who
set her cap at the gentleman with the long Grecian
nose, and she entered into her devastated frame of mind
when he wriggled awkwardly out of further osculatory
invitations. And the good, solid plumber, onion-loving
soul, had carried her off, not figuratively but
literally under the nose of Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Martin, you’re too funny for words!” she
cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras smiled always benevolently. “If Cleopatra’s
nose had been a centimetre longer—I forget
the exact classical epigram—the history of the world
would have been changed. In a minor degree—for
the destiny of an individual must, of course, be of
less importance than the destiny of mankind—had
it not been for one spring onion, unconsidered fellow
of the robin and the burnished dove and the wanton
lapwing, this young man’s fancy would have been fettered
in the thoughts of love. One spring onion—and
human destinies are juggled. Martin is still a soul-starved
bachelor, and—and—her name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gwendoline?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Gwendoline is the buxom mother of five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six,” said Martin. “I can’t help knowing,” he
explained, “since I still lodge with her mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna turned her head sideways to scrutinise the
drawing on the tablecloth, and still scrutinising it,
asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is your one and only <span class='it'>affaire du cœur</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid the only one,” replied Martin shamefacedly.
Even so mild a man as he felt the disadvantage
of not being able to hint to a woman that
he could talk, and he would, of chimes heard at midnight
and of broken hearts and other circumstances
hedging round a devil of a fellow. His one kiss
seemed a very bread-and-buttery affair—to say nothing
of the mirth-provoking onion. And the emotion
attending the approach to it had been of a nature
so tepid that disillusion caused scarcely a pang. It
had been better to pose as an out-and-out Sir Galahad,
a type comprehensible to women. As the hero of one
invertebrate embrace he cut a sorry figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are still young. The years and the women’s
lips before you are many,” said Fortinbras, laying a
comforting touch on Martin’s shoulder. “Opportunity
makes the lover as it does the thief. And in the
bed-sitting-room in Hickney Heath where you have
spent your young life where has been the opportunity?
It pleases our Paris-hardened young friend to mock;
but I see in you the making of a great lover, a Bertrand
d’Allamanon, a Chastelard, one who will count the
world well lost for a princess’s smile——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna interrupted. “What pernicious nonsense
are you talking, Fortinbras? You’ve got love on the
brain to-night. Neither Martin nor I are worrying
our heads about it. Love be hanged! We’re each of
us worried to death over the problem of how to keep
body and soul together without going back to prison
and you talk all this drivel about love—at least not
to me, but to Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That qualification, my dear Corinna, upsets the
logic of your admirable tirade,” Fortinbras replied
calmly, after drinking the remainder of his syrup
and soda water. “I speak of love to Martin because
his soul is starved, as I’ve already declared. I don’t
speak of it to you, because your soul is suffering from
indigestion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have another <span class='it'>kummel glacé</span>,” said Corinna.
“It’s a stomachic.” She reached for the bell-pull behind
her chair—she had the corner seat. Auguste
appeared. Orders were repeated. “How you can
drink all that syrup without being sick I can’t understand,”
she remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Omnicomprehension is not vouchsafed even to the
very young and innocent, my dear,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin glanced across the table apprehensively. If
ever young woman had been set down that young
woman was Corinna Hastings. He feared explosion,
annihilation of the down-setter. Nothing of the sort
happened. Corinna accepted the rebuff with the meekness
of a school-girl and sniffed when Fortinbras was
not looking. Again Martin was puzzled, unable to
divest himself of his old conception of Corinna. She
was Corinna, chartered libertine of the land of Rodolfe,
Marcel, Schaunard—he had few impressions
of the <span class='it'>Quartier Latin</span> later than Henri Murger—and
her utterances no matter how illogical were derived
from godlike inspiration. He hung on her lips for
some inspired and vehement rejoinder to the rebuke
of Fortinbras. When none came he realised that in
the seedily dressed and now profusely perspiring
<span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur</span> she had met an acknowledged
master. Who Fortinbras was, whence his origin,
what his character and social status, how, save by the
precarious methods to which he had alluded, he earned
his livelihood, Martin had no idea; but he suddenly
conceived an immense respect for Fortinbras. The
man hovered over both of them on a higher plane of
wisdom. From his kind eyes (to Martin’s simple
fancy) beamed uncanny power. He assumed the semblance
of an odd sort of god indigenous to this Paris
wonderworld.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras lit another of Martin’s Virginian cigarettes—the
little tin box lay open on the table—and
leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My young friends,” said he, “you have each put
before me the circumstances which have made you
respectively despair of finding happiness both in the
immediate and the distant future. Now as Montaigne
says—an author whom I would recommend to you
for the edification of your happily remote middle-age,
having myself found infinite consolation in his sagacity—as
Montaigne says: ‘Men are tormented by
the ideas they have concerning things, and not by the
things themselves.’ The wise man therefore—the
general term, my dear Corinna, includes women—is he
who has learned to face things themselves after having
dispelled the bogies of his ideas concerning them.
It is on this basis that I am about to deliver the judgment
for which I have duly received my fee of ten
francs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moistened his lips with the pink syrup. For
the picture you can imagine a grey old lion eating ice-cream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, Corinna,” he continued, “belong to the new
race of women whose claims on life far exceed their
justification. You have as assets youth, a modicum
of beauty, a bright intelligence and a stiff little character.
But, as you rightly say, you are capable of
nothing in the steep range of human effort from painting
a picture to washing a baby. Were you not temperamentally
puritanical and intellectually obsessed
by the modern notion of woman’s right to an independent
existence, you would find a means of realising
the above-mentioned assets, as your sex has done
through the centuries. But in spite of amazonian
trifling with romantic-visaged and granite-headed
medical students, you cling to the irresponsibilities of
a celibate career.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he asked me, I’d marry a Turk to-morrow,”
said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t interrupt,” said Fortinbras. “You disturb
the flow of my ideas. I have no doubt that, in your
desperate situation, you would promise to marry a
Turk; but your essential pusillanimity would make you
wriggle out of it at the last moment. You’re like
‘the poor cat in the adage.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What cat?” asked Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The one in Macbeth, Act i, Scene 3, a play by
Shakespeare. ‘Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I
would,” like the poor cat i’ the adage.’ You require
development, my dear Corinna, out of the cat stage.
You have had your head choked with ideas about
things in this soul-suffocating Paris, and the ideas
are tormenting you; but you’ve never been at grips
with things themselves. As for our excellent Martin,
he has not even arrived at the stage of the desirous
cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smile that lit up his coarse, lined features, and
the musical suavity of his voice divested the words
of offence. Martin, with a laugh, assented to the
proposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He, too, needs development,” Fortinbras went on.
“Or rather, not so much development as a collection
of soul-material from which development may proceed.
Your one accomplishment, I understand, is
riding a bicycle. Let us take that as the germ from
which the tree of happiness may spring. Do you
bicycle, Corinna?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can, of course. But I hate it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t,” replied Fortinbras quickly. “You
hate your own idea of it. You’ll begin your course
of happiness by sweeping away all your ideas concerning
bicycling and coming to bicycling itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard anything so idiotic,” declared Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless,” smiled Fortinbras. “You haven’t
heard everything. Go on your knees and thank God
for it. I repeat—or amplify my prescription. Go
forth both of you on bicycles into the wide world.
They will not be Wheels of Chance, but Wheels of
Destiny. Go through the broad land of France filling
your souls with sunshine and freedom and your
throats with salutary and thirst-provoking dust. Have
no care for the morrow and look at the future through
the golden haze of eventide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing I should like better,” said Martin,
with a glance at Corinna, “but I can’t afford it. I
must get back to London to look out for an engagement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras mopped his brow with an over-fatigued
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you pay me five francs for? For the
pleasure of hearing me talk, or for the value of my
counsel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must look at things practically,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, good God!” cried Fortinbras, with soft uplifted
hands, “what is there more practical, more commonplace,
less romantic in the world than riding a
bicycle? You want to emerge from your Slough of
Despond, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I say—get on a bicycle and ride out of it.
Practical to the point of pathos.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin objected: “No one will pay me for careering
through France on a bicycle. I’ve got to live, and
for the matter of fact, so has Corinna.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear young friend, she has twenty
pounds. You, on your own showing have forty.
Sixty pounds between you. A fortune! You both
are tormented by the idea of what will happen when
the Pactolus runs dry. Banish that pestilential miasma
from your minds. Go on the adventure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In poetic terms he set forth the delights of that
admirable vagabondage. His eloquence sent a thrill
through Martin’s veins, causing his blood to tingle.
Before him new horizons broadened. He felt the
necessity of the immediate securing of an engagement
grow less insistent. If he got home with twenty
pounds in his pocket, even fifteen, at a pinch ten, he
could manage to subsist until he found work. And
perhaps this blandly authoritative, though seedy angel
really saw into the future. The temptation fascinated
him. He glanced again at Corinna, who sat demure
and silent, her chin propped on her fists, and his heart
sank. The proposition was absurd. How could he
ride abroad, for an indefinite number of days and
nights with a young unmarried woman? Of himself
he had no fear. Undesirous cat though he was, sent
forth on the journey into the world to learn desire,
he could not but remain a gentleman. In his charge
she would enjoy a sister’s sanctity. But she would
never consent. She could not. No matter how profound
her belief in his chivalry, her maiden modesty
would revolt. Her reputation would be gone. One
whisper in Wendlebury of such gipsying and scandal
with bared scissor-points would arrest her on the station
platform. And while these thoughts agitated his
mind, and Corinna kept her eyes always demure and
somewhat ironical on Fortinbras, the latter continued
to talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not advising you,” said he, “to pedal away like
little Pilgrims into the Unknown. I propose for you
an objective. In the little town of Brantôme in the
Dordogne, made illustrious by one of the quaintest
of French writers——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Abbé Brantôme of ‘<span class='it'>La Vie des Dames Galantes</span>’?”
asked Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin gasped. “You don’t know that book?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By heart,” she replied mischievously, in order to
shock Martin. As a matter of fact she had but
turned over the pages of the immortal work and laid
it down, disconcerted both by the archaic French and
the full flavour of such an anecdote or two as she
could understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the little town of Brantôme,” Fortinbras continued
after a pause, “you will find an hotel called
the Hôtel des Grottes, kept by an excellent and massive
man by the name of Bigourdin, a poet and a
philosopher and a mighty maker of <span class='it'>pâté de foie gras</span>.
A line from me would put you on his lowest tariff,
for he has a descending scale of charges, one for
motorists, another for commercial travellers and a
third for human beings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be utterly delightful,” Martin interrupted,
“if it were possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t it be possible?” asked Corinna
with a calm glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and I—alone—the proprieties——” he stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Corinna burst out laughing. “Is that what’s
worrying you? My poor Martin, you’re too comic.
What are you afraid of? I promise you I’ll respect
maiden modesty. My word of honour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is entirely on your account. But if you don’t
mind—” said Martin politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I assure you I don’t mind in the least,” replied
Corinna with equal politeness. “But supposing,” she
turned to Fortinbras, “we do go on this journey, what
should we do when we got to the great Monsieur
Bigourdin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would sun yourselves in his wisdom,” replied
Fortinbras, “and convey my love to my little daughter
Félise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Fortinbras had alluded to his possession of a
steam-yacht Corinna could not have been more astonished.
To her he was merely the Marchand de
Bonheur, eccentric Bohemian, half charlatan, half
good-fellow, without private life or kindred. She
sat bolt upright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a daughter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? Am I not a man? Haven’t I lived my
life? Haven’t I had my share of its joys and sorrows?
Why should it surprise you that I have a
daughter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna reddened. “You haven’t told me about her
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do I have the occasion, in this world of
students, to speak of things precious to me? I tell
you now. I am sending you to her—she is twenty—and
to my excellent brother-in-law Bigourdin,
because I think you are good children, and I
should like to give you a bit of my heart for my ten
francs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fortinbras,” said Corinna, with a quick outstretch
of her arm, “I’m a beast. Tell me, what is she
like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To me,” smiled Fortinbras, “she is like one of the
wild flowers from which Alpine honey is made. To
other people she is doubtless a well-mannered commonplace
young person. You will see her and judge
for yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far is it from Paris to Brantôme?” asked
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roughly about five hundred kilometres—under
three hundred miles. Take your time. You have
sixty pounds’ worth of sunny hours before you—and
there is much to be learned in three hundred miles
of France. In a few weeks’ time I will join you at
Brantôme—journeying by train as befits my soberer
age—I go there a certain number of times a year to
see Félise. Then, if you will continue to favour me
with your patronage, we shall have another consultation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a brief silence. Fortinbras looked from
one young face to the other. Then he brought his
hands down with a soft thump on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hesitate?” he cried indignantly. “You’re
afraid to take your poor, little lives in your hands
even for a few weeks?” He pushed back his chair
and rose and swept a banning gesture, “I have nothing
more to do with you. For profitless advice my
conscience allows me to charge nothing.” He tore
open his frock coat and his fingers diving into his
waistcoat pocket brought forth and threw down the
two five-franc pieces. “Go your ways,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this dramatic moment both the young people
sprang protesting to their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you talking about? We’re going to
Brantôme,” cried Corinna, gripping the lapels of his
coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course we are,” exclaimed Martin, scared at the
prospect of losing the inspired counsellor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why aren’t you more enthusiastic?” asked
Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we are enthusiastic,” Corinna declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll start to-morrow,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At six o’clock in the morning,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At five, if you like,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras embraced them both in a capacious smile,
as he deliberately repocketed the coins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is well, my children. But don’t do too many
unaccustomed things at once. In the Dordogne you
can rise at five—with enjoyment and impunity. In
Paris, your meeting at that hour would be fraught
with mutual antipathy, and you would not find a
shop open where you could hire or buy your bicycles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got one,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So have I,” said Martin; “but it’s in London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras extracted from his person a dim, chainless
watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is now a quarter past one. Time for honest
folk to be abed. Meet me here at eleven o’clock to-morrow,
booted and spurred, with but a scrip at the
back of your bicycles, and I will hand you letters to
Félise and the poetic and philosophic Bigourdin, and
now,” said he, “with your permission, I will ring
for Auguste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Auguste appeared and Martin, waving aside the
protests of Corinna, paid the modest bill. In the airless
street Fortinbras bade them an impressive good
night and disappeared in the byways of the sultry
city. Martin accompanied Corinna to the gaunt
neighbouring building wherein her eyrie was situate.
Both were tongue-tied, shy, embarrassed by the prospect
of the intimate adventure to which they had
pledged themselves. When the great door, swung
open by the hidden concierge, at Corinna’s ring, invited
her entrance, they shook hands perfunctorily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At a quarter to eleven,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be ready,” said Corinna.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span><h1>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> bicycle journey of two young people through
a mere three hundred miles of France is, on
the face of it, an Odyssey of no importance.
The only interest that could attach itself to such a
humdrum affair would centre in the development of
tender feelings reciprocated or otherwise in the
breasts of both or one of the young people. But
when the two of them proceed dustily and unemotionally
along the endless, straight, poplar-bordered
roads, with the heart of each at the end of the day
as untroubled by the other as at the beginning, a detailed
account of their wanderings would resolve itself
into a commonplace itinerary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My children,” said Fortinbras, when, after having
lunched with them at the Petit Cornichon and
given them letters of introduction and his blessing, he
had accompanied them to the pavement whence they
were preparing to start, “I advise you, until you
reach Brantôme to call yourself brother and sister,
so that your idyllic companionship shall not be misinterpreted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh!”—or some such vocable of scorn—Corinna
remarked. “We’re not in narrow-minded England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In narrow-minded England,” Fortinbras replied,
“without a wedding ring, and without the confessed
brother-and-sisterly relation, inns would close their
virtuous doors against you. In France, where a pair
of lovers is universally regarded as an object of romantic
interest, innkeepers would confuse you with
zealous attentions. Thus in either country, though
for opposite reasons, you would be bound to encounter
impossible embarrassment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think there would be any danger of that,”
laughed Corinna lightly, “unless Martin went mad.
But perhaps it would be just as well to play the comedy.
I’ll stick up my cheek to be kissed every night
in the presence of the landlady. ‘<span class='it'>Bon soir, mon frère.</span>’—Do
you think you can go through the performance,
Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, very uncomfortable, already experiencing
at the suggestion of misconstrued relations, the embarrassment
foreshadowed by Fortinbras, flushed
deeply and took refuge in an examination of his
bicycle. The celibate dreamer was shocked by her
cool bravado. Since the episode of Gwendoline he
had lived remote from the opposite sex; the only
woman he had known intimately was his mother
and from that knowledge he had formed the profound
conviction that women were entirely futile and
utterly holy. Corinna kept on knocking this conviction
endwise. She made hay, not to say chaos, with
his theory of woman. He felt himself on the verge
of a fog-filled abysm of knowledge. There she stood,
a foot or two away—he scarce dared glance at her—erect,
clear-eyed, the least futile person in the world,
treating a suggestion the most disconcerting and appalling
to maidenhood with the unholiest mockery,
and coolly proposing that, in order to give themselves
an air of innocence, they should contract the habit of
a nightly embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do anything,” said he, “to prevent disagreeableness
arising.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna laughed, and, after final farewells, they
rode away down the baking little street leaving Fortinbras
watching them wistfully until they had disappeared.
And he remained a long time following in
his thoughts the pair whom he had despatched upon
their unsentimental journey. How young they were,
how malleable, how agape for hope like young
thrushes for worms, how attractive in their respective
ways, how careless of sunstroke! If only he could
have escaped with them from this sweltering Paris
to the cool shadow of the Dordogne rocks and the
welcome of a young girl’s eyes. What a hopeless
mess and muddle was life. He sighed and mopped
his forehead, and then a hand touched his arm. He
turned and saw the careworn face of Madame Gaussart,
the fat wife of a neighbouring print-seller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Fortinbras, it is only you in this city
of misfortune that can give me advice. My husband
left me the day before yesterday and has not returned.
I am in despair. I have been weeping ever since. I
weep now——” she did, copiously regardless of the
gaze of the street. “Tell me what to do, my good
Monsieur Fortinbras, you whom they call the
<span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur</span>. See—I have your little honorarium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held out the five-franc piece. Fortinbras slipped
it into his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At your service, madame,” said he, with a sigh.
“Doubtless I shall be able to restore to you a fallacious
semblance of conjugal felicity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sure of it,” said the lady already comforted.
“If you would deign to enter the shop, Monsieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras followed her, and for a while lost his
envy of Martin and Corinna in patient and ironic consideration
of the naughtiness of Monsieur Gaussart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This first stage out of Paris was the only time when
the wanderers braved the midday heat of the golden
August. They took counsel together in an earwiggy
arbour outside Versailles, where they quenched their
thirst with cider. They were in no hurry to reach
their destination. A few hours in the early morning—they
could start at six—and an hour or two
in the cool of the evening would suffice. The remainder
of the day would be devoted to repose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And churches and cathedrals,” added Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a frolicsome idea of a holiday jaunt,”
said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else can we do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eat lotus,” said Corinna. “Forget that there ever
were such places as Paris or London or Wendlebury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think Chartres would remind you of one
of them,” said Martin. “I’ve dreamed of Chartres
ever since I read ‘<span class='it'>La Cathédrale</span>’ by Huysmans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re what they call an earnest soul,” remarked
Corinna. “All the way here I’ve never stopped wondering
why I’ve come with you on this insane pilgrimage
to nowhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been wondering the same myself,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he had lain awake most of the night and therefore
risen late, the occupations of the morning involving
the selection and hire of a bicycle, consultation
with the concierge of the Hôtel du Soleil et de l’Ecosse
with regard to luggage being forwarded, the changing
of his money into French banknotes and gold, and
various small purchases, had left him little time for
reflection. It was only when he found himself pedalling
perspiringly by the side of this comparatively unknown
and startling young woman, who was to be his
intimate companion for heaven knew how long, that
he began to think. <span class='it'>Qu’allait il faire dans cette galère?</span>
It was comforting to know that Corinna asked herself
the same question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That old humbug Fortinbras must have put a
spell upon us,” she continued, without commenting
on Martin’s lack of gallantry. “He sort of envelops
one in such a mist of words uttered in that musical
voice of his and he looks so inspired with benevolent
wisdom that one loses one’s common sense. The old
wretch can persuade anybody to do anything. He
once inveigled a girl—an art student—into becoming
a nun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s Protestant antagonism was aroused. He
expressed himself heatedly. He saw nothing but
reprehensibility in the action of Fortinbras. Corinna
examined her well-trimmed fingernails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a question of Saint Clothilde—that I think
was the order—or Saint Lazare. Some girls are
like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saint Lazare?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know anything?” she sighed. “What’s
the good of being decently epigrammatic? Saint
Lazare is the final destination of a certain temperament
unsupported by good looks or money. It’s the
woman’s prison of Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How he did it I don’t know, but he saved her
body and soul. And now she’s the happiest creature
in the world. I had a letter from her only the other
day urging me to go over to Rome and take the
vows——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you’re not thinking of it,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m in no danger of Saint Lazare,” replied Corinna
drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long silence. In the leafy arbour
screened from the dust and glare of the highway there
prevailed a drowsy peace. Only one of the dozen
other green blistered wooden tables was occupied—and
that by a blue-bloused workman and his wife and
baby, all temperately refreshing themselves with harmless
liquid, the last from nature’s fount itself. The
landlord, obese, unshaven and alpaca-jacketed, read
the <span class='it'>Petit Journal</span> at the threshold of the café of which
the arboured terrace was but a summer adjunct. A
mangy mongrel lying at his feet snapped spasmodically
at flies. A couple of tow-headed urchins hung by
the arched entrance, low-class Peris at the gates of a
dilapidated Paradise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is Fortinbras?” Martin asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna shrugged her dainty shoulders. She did
not know. Rumour had it—and for rumour she could
not vouchsafe—that he was an English solicitor struck
off the rolls. With French law at any rate he was
familiar. He had the Code Napoléon at his finger-ends.
In spite of the sober black clothes and white
tie of the French attorney which he affected, he certainly
possessed no French qualifications which would
have enabled him to set up a regular <span class='it'>cabinet d’avoué</span>
and earn a professional livelihood. Nor did he presume
to step within the <span class='it'>avoué’s</span> jealously guarded
sphere. But his opinion on legal points was so sound,
and his fee so moderate, that many consulted him in
preference to an orthodox practitioner. That was all
that Corinna knew of him in his legal aspect. The
rest of his queer practice consisted in advising in all
manner of complications. He arbitrated in disputes
between man and man, woman and woman, lover and
mistress, husband and wife, parent and child. He diverted
the debtor from the path to bankruptcy. He
rescued youths and maidens from disastrous nymphs
and fauns. He hushed up scandal. Meanwhile his
private life and even his address remained unknown.
Twice a day he went the round of the cafés and restaurants
of the <span class='it'>quartier</span>, so that those in need of his
assistance had but to wait at their respective taverns
in order to see him—for he appeared with the inevitability
of the sun in its course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are all kinds of parasitical people,” said
Corinna, “who try to sponge on students for drinks
and meals and money—but Fortinbras isn’t that kind.
Now and again, but not often, he will accept an invitation
to lunch or dinner—and then it’s always for the
purpose of discussing business. Whether it’s his cunning
or his honesty I don’t know—but nobody’s afraid
of him. That’s his great asset. You’re absolutely
certain sure that he won’t stick you for anything.
Consequently anybody in trouble or difficulty goes to
him confident that his five francs consultation fee is
the end of the financial side of the matter and that he
will concentrate his whole mind and soul on the case.
He’s an odd devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most remarkable man I’ve ever met,” said
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve not met many,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know——” replied Martin reflectively. “I
once came across a prize-fighter—a remarkable chap—in
the bar-parlour of the pub at the corner of our
street who was afterwards hanged for murdering his
wife, and I once met a member of Parliament, another
remarkable man—I forget his name now—and
then of course there was Cyrus Margett.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But none of them is in it with Fortinbras,” Corinna
smiled with ironic indulgence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None,” said Martin, “had his peculiar magnetic
quality. Not even the member of Parliament. But,”
he continued after a pause, “is that all that is known
of him? He seems to be a very mysterious person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t mind betting you,” said Corinna, “that
you and I are the only people in Paris who are aware
of his daughter in Brantôme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should he single us out for such a confidence?”
asked Martin. “He said last night that he
was giving us a bit of his heart because we were
good children—it was quite touching—but why should
we be the only ones to have a bit of his heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like to know?” asked Corinna, meeting
his eyes full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He told me before you turned up at the Petit
Cornichon, this morning, that you interested him as
a sort of celestial freak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure whether to take that as a compliment
or not,” replied Martin, pausing in the act of rolling
a cigarette. “It’s tantamount to calling me an infernal
ass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this show of spirit the girl swiftly changed her
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may take it from me that Fortinbras doesn’t
give a bit of his heart to infernal asses. If I had
gone to him, on my own, he would never—you heard
him—he would never have touched on ‘things precious
to him.’ It’s for your sake, not mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he’s fed up with the likes of me,” said
Corinna, with sudden bitterness. “There are hundreds
and thousands of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin knitted his brow. “I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better not try,” she said. “Let us pay for the
cider and get on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they paid and went on and halted at the townlet
of Rambouillet, where as Monsieur and Mademoiselle
Overshaw, they engaged rooms at the most modest
of terms. And to Martin’s infinite relief Corinna did
not summon him to kiss her cheek in the presence of
the landlady, before they retired for the night. He
went to bed comforted by the thought that Corinna’s
bark was worse than her bite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have done my best to tell you that this was an
unsentimental journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So day after day they sped their innocent course,
resting by night at tiny places where haughty automobiles
halted not. They had but sixty pounds to
their joint fortune, and it behoved them not to dissipate
it in unwonted luxury. Through Chartres they
went, and Corinna quite as eagerly as Martin drank
in deep draughts of its Gothic mystery and its splendour
of stained glass; through Châteaudun with its
grim old castle; through Vendôme with the flaming
west front of its cathedral; through Tours in the
neighbourhood of which they lingered many days,
seeing in familiar intimacy things of which they had
but dreamed before—Chinon, Loches, Chenonceaux,
Azay-le-Rideau, perhaps the most delicate of all the
châteaux of the Loire. And following the counsel of
a sage Fortinbras they went but a few kilometres out
of their way and visited Richelieu, the fascinating
town known only to the wanderer, himself judicious
or judiciously advised, that was built by the great Cardinal
outside his palace gates for the accommodation
of his court; and there it remains now untouched by
time, priceless jewel of the art of Louis Treize, with
its walls and gates and church and market square and
stately central thoroughfare of <span class='it'>hôtels</span> for the nobles,
each having its mansard roof and <span class='it'>porte-cochère</span>
giving entrance to court and garden; and there it
remains dozing in prosperity, for around it spread
the vineyards which supply brandy to the wide, wide
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was here that Martin, sitting with Corinna on a
blistered bench beneath a plane tree in the little market-place,
said for the first time:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t seem to care whether I ever see England
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about getting another billet?” asked Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England and billets are synonymous terms. The
further I go the less important does it appear that I
should get one. At any rate the more loathsome is
the prospect of a return to slavery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let us talk of it,” she said, fanning herself
with her hat. “The mere thought of going back turns
the sun grey. Let us imagine we’re just going on
and on for ever and ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been doing so in a general way,” he replied.
“I’ve been living in a sort of intoxication; but now
and then I wake up and have a lucid interval. And
then I feel that by not sitting on the doorstep of
scholastic agents I’m doing something wrong, something
almost immoral—and it gives me an unholy
thrill of delight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was a small child,” said Corinna, “I used
to take the Ten Commandments one by one and secretly
break them, just to see what would happen. Some
I didn’t know how to break—the seventh for instance,
which worried me—and others referring to stealing
and murder were rather too stiff propositions. But
I chipped out with a nail on a tile a little graven image
and I bowed down and worshipped it in great excitement;
and as father used to tell us that the third commandment
included all kinds of swearing, I used to
bend over an old well we had in the garden and whisper
‘Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn,’ until the awful
joy of it made my flesh creep. I think, Martin, you
can’t be more than ten years old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you spoil a bit of sympathetic comprehension
by that last remark?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you jib at truth?” she retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you like a child revelling in naughtiness—naughtiness
just for the sake of being naughty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I am,” said he. “But why do you mock
at me for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I’m mocking,” she answered more
seriously. “When I said you were only ten years old
I meant to be rather affectionate. I seem to be ever
so old in experience, and you never to have grown up.
You’re so refreshing after all these people I’ve been
mixed up with—mostly lots younger really than you—who
have plumbed the depths of human knowledge
and have fished up the dregs and holding them out in
their hands say, ‘See what it all comes to!’ I’m dead
sick of them. So to consort, as I’ve been doing, with
an ingenuous mind like yours, is a real pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin rose from his seat and a tortoiseshell cat, the
only other denizen of the market-place, startled from
intimate ablutions, gazed at him, still poising a forward
thrown hind leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Corinna,” said he, “I would beg you to
believe that I’m not so damned ingenuous as all that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For reply Corinna laughed out loud, whereupon the
cat fled. She rose too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us look at the church and cool this heat of
controversy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they visited the Louis XIII church, and continued
their journey. And the idle days passed and
nothing happened of any importance. They talked
a vast deal and now and then wrangled. After his
sturdy declaration at Richelieu, Martin resented her
gibes at his ingenuousness. He felt that it was incumbent
on him to play the man. At first Corinna had
taken command of their tour, ordaining routes and
making contracts with innkeepers. These functions he
now usurped; the former to advantage, for he discovered
that Corinna’s splendid misreading of maps had
led them devious and unprofitable courses; the latter
to the disgusted remonstrance of Corinna, who found
the charges preposterously increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care,” said Martin. “I don’t mind your
treating me as a brother, but I’m not going to be
treated as your little brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the freedom and adventure of their unremarkable
pilgrimage, he had begun to develop, to lose the
fear of her ironical tongue, to crave some sort of
self-assertion, if not of self-expression. He also discovered
in her certain little feminine frailties which
flatteringly aroused his masculine sense of superiority.
Once they were overtaken by a thunderstorm and in
the cowshed to which they had raced for shelter,
she sat fear-stricken, holding hands to ears at every
clap, while Martin, hands in pockets, stood serene at
the doorway interested in the play of the lightning.
What was there to be afraid of? Far more dangerous
to cross London or Paris streets or to take a railway
journey. Her unreasoning terror was woman’s
weakness, a mere matter of nerves. He would be indulgent;
so turning from the door, he put his water-proof
cape over her shoulders as she was feeling cold,
and the humility with which she accepted his services
afforded him considerable gratification. Of course,
when the sun came out, she carried her head high
and soon found occasion for a gibe; but Martin rode
on unheeding. These were situations in which he was
master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once, also, in order to avoid a drove of steers emerging
from a farm-yard gate, she had swerved violently
into a ditch and twisted her ankle. As she could
neither walk nor ride, he picked her up in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you to the farm house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t possibly carry me,” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll soon show you,” said Martin, and he carried
her. And although she was none too light and his
muscles strained beneath her weight, he rejoiced in her
surprised appreciation of his man’s strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But half way she railed, white lipped: “I suppose
you’re quite certain now you’re my big brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly certain,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he felt her grip around his neck relax
and her body weigh dead in his arms and he saw that
she had fainted from the pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving her in the care of the kind farm people, he
went to retrieve the abandoned bicycles and reflected
on the occurrence. In the first place he would not
have lost his head on encountering a set of harmless
steers; secondly, had he accidentally twisted his ankle,
Corinna could not have carried him; thirdly he would
not have fainted; fourthly, mocking as her last words
had been, she had confessed her inferiority; all of
which was most comforting to his self-esteem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, some time afterwards, when the farmer put
her into a broken-down equipage covered with a vast
hood and drawn by a gaunt horse, rustily caparisoned,
in order to drive her to the nearest inn some five kilometres
distant, Martin superintended the arrangements,
leaving Corinna not a word to say. He rode,
a mounted constable, by her side, and on arriving at
the inn carried her up to her room and talked with
much authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, having passed through Poitiers and Ruffec,
they came, three weeks after their start from Paris,
to Angoulême, daintiest of cities, perched on its bastioned
rocks above the Charente. And here, as it was
the penultimate stage of their journey, they sojourned
a few days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood on the shady rampart and gazed over
the red-roofed houses embowered in greenery at the
great plain golden in harvest and drenched in sunshine,
and sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dread Brantôme,” said Corinna. “It marks
something definite. Hitherto we have been going
along vaguely, in a sort of stupefied dream. At Brantôme
we’ll have to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve no doubt it will do us good,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fail to see it,” said Corinna. “We’ll just have
the same old worry over again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure,” Martin answered. “In the first
place we’re not quite the same people as we were
three weeks ago——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not the same person at any rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “Because you give yourself airs nowadays?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even my giving myself airs,” he replied soberly,
“denotes a change. But it’s deeper than that—it’s
difficult to explain. I feel I have a grip on myself I
hadn’t before,—and also an intensity of delight in
things I never had before. The first half hour or so
of our rides in the early dewy mornings, our rough
<span class='it'>déjeuners</span> outside the little cafés, the long, drowsy afternoons
under the trees, watching the lazy life of the
road—the wine wagons and the bullock carts and the
sunburnt men and women—and the brown, dusty children
with their goats—and the quiet evenings under
the stars when we have either sat alone saying nothing
or else talked to the <span class='it'>patron</span> of the <span class='it'>auberge</span> and listened
to his simple philosophy of life. And then to
sleep drunk with air and sunshine between the clean
coarse sheets—to sleep like a dog until the scurry of
the house wakes you at dawn—I don’t know,” he
fetched up lamely. “It has been a thrill, morning,
noon and night—and my life before this was remarkably
devoid of thrills. Of course,” he added after a
slight pause, “you have had a good deal to do with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Je te remercie infiniment, mon frère</span>,” said Corinna.
“That is as much as to say I’ve not been a too
dull companion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been a delightful companion,” he cried boyishly.
“I had no idea a girl could be so—so——”
He sought for a word with his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes smiled on him and lips shewed ever so
delicate a curl of irony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So companionable,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed again. “What exactly do you mean
by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So sensible,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When a man calls a girl sensible, do you know
what he means? He means that she doesn’t expect
him to fall in love with her. Now you haven’t fallen
in love with me, have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin from his lolling position on the parapet
sprang erect. “I should never dream of such a
thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed loud and grasped the lapels of his
jacket. “Oh, Martin!” she cried, “you’re a gem, a
rare jewel. You haven’t changed one little bit. And
for Heaven’s sake don’t change!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you mean that I haven’t turned from a gentleman
into a cad, then I haven’t changed,” said Martin
freeing himself, “and I’m glad of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tossed her head and the laughter died from
her face. “I don’t see how you would be a cad to
have fallen in love with a girl who is neither unattractive
nor a fool, and has been your sole companion
from morning to night for three weeks. Ninety-nine
men out of a hundred would have done it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it,” said Martin. “I have a higher
estimate of the honour of my fellow-men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that’s your opinion of me——” she said, and
turning swiftly walked away. Martin overtook her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me to fall in love with you?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She halted for a second and stamped her foot. “No.
Ten thousand times no. If you did I’d throw vitriol
over you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She marched on. Martin followed in an obfuscated
frame of mind. She led the way round the ramparts
and out into the narrow, cobble-paved streets of the
old town, past dilapidated glories of the Renaissance,
where once great nobles had entertained kings and
now the proletariat hung laundry to dry over royal
salamanders and proud escutcheons, past the Maison
de Saint Simon, with its calm and time-mellowed
ornament and exquisite oriels, past things over which,
but yesterday, but that morning, they had lingered
lovingly, into the Place du Mûrier. There she paused,
as if seeking her bearings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going?” asked Martin, somewhat
breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To some place where I can be alone,” she flashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said he, and raised his cap and left
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few seconds he heard her call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned. “Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m anything you like to call me,” she said. “It’s
not your fault. It’s my temper. But you’ve got to
learn it’s better not to turn women down flat like
that, even when they speak in jest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very sorry, Corinna,” he said, smiling gravely,
“but when one jests on such subjects I don’t know
where I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crossed the square slowly, side by side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose neither you nor anybody else could understand,”
she said. “I was angry with you, but if
you had played the fool I should have been angrier
still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked straight ahead with a strained glance
and for a minute or two did not reply. At last:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember Fortinbras mentioning the name of
Camille Fargot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he at Brantôme?” asked Martin, with brow
perplexed by the memory of the ridiculous
mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I wish to God he was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you engaged?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a sort of a way,” said Corinna, gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t see a little bit in the world, she retorted
with a sudden laugh. “You’re utterly mystified.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not,” he declared stoutly. “Why on earth
shouldn’t you have a love affair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you insinuated that none of your ‘fellow
men’ would look at me twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He contracted his brows and regarded her steadily.
“I’m beginning to get tired of this argument,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes drooped first. “Perhaps you really have
progressed a bit since we started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was doing my best to tell you, when you switched
off onto this idiot circuit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she put out her hand. “Don’t let us quarrel,
Martin. What has been joy and wonder to you
has been merely an anodyne to me. I’m about the
most miserable girl in France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you had told me something of this before,”
said Martin, “because I’ve been feeling myself the
happiest man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HERE</span> is six o’clock striking and those English
have not yet arrived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus spake Gaspard-Marie Bigourdin, landlord
of the Hôtel des Grottes, a vast man clad in a
brown holland suit and a soft straw hat with a gigantic
brim. So vast was he that his person overlapped in
all directions the Austrian bent-wood rocking-chair in
which he was taking the cool of the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They said they would come in time for dinner,
<span class='it'>mon oncle</span>,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a graceful slip of a girl, dark-eyed, refined
of feature. Fortinbras with paternal fondness,
if you remember, had likened her to the wild flowers
from which Alpine honey was made. And indeed,
she suggested wild fragrance. Her brown hair was
done up on the top of her head and fastened by a
comb like that of all the peasant girls of the district;
but she wore the blouse and stuff skirt of the well-to-do
bourgeoisie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six o’clock is already time for dinner in Brantôme,”
remarked Monsieur Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are accustomed to the hours of London and
Paris, where I’ve heard they dine at eight or nine or
any time that pleases them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In London and Paris they get up at midday and
go to bed at dawn. They are coming here purposely
to dis-habilitate themselves from the ways of London
and Paris. At least so your father gives me to understand.
It is a bad beginning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am longing to see them,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you see enough English? Ten years ago an
Englishman at Brantôme was a curiosity. All the inhabitants,
you among them, <span class='it'>ma petite</span> Félise, used to
run two kilometres to look at him. But now, with the
automobile, they are as familiar in the eyes of the
good Brantômois as truffles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this simile Monsieur Bigourdin did not mean to
convey the idea that the twelve hundred inhabitants
of Brantôme were all gastronomic voluptuaries. It
is true that Brantôme battens on <span class='it'>pâté de foie gras</span>; but
it is the essence of its existence, seeing that Brantôme
makes it and sells it and with pigs and dogs
hunts the truffles without which <span class='it'>pâté de foie gras</span>
would be a comestible of fat absurdity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But no English have been sent before by my father,”
said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” replied Bigourdin, with a capacious
smile, showing white strong teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are the first people—French or English, I
shall have met who know my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true also,” said Bigourdin. “And they
must be droll types like your excellent father himself.
<span class='it'>Tiens</span>, let me see again what he says about them.” He
searched his pockets, a process involving convulsions
of his frame which made the rocking-chair creak.
“It must be in my black jacket,” said he at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get it,” said Félise, and went into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin rolled and lit a cigarette and gave himself
up to comfortable reflection. The Hôtel des
Grottes was built on the slope of a rock and the loggia
or verandah on which Bigourdin was taking his ease,
hung over a miniature precipice. At the bottom ran
the River Dronne encircling most of the old-world
town and crossed here and there by flashing little
bridges. Away to the northeast loomed the mountains
of the Limousin where the river has its source.
The tiny place slumbered in the slanting sunshine.
The sight of Brantôme stretched out below him was
inseparable from Bigourdin’s earliest conception of
the universe. In the Hôtel des Grottes he had been
born; there, save for a few years at Lyons whither
he had been sent by his mother in order to widen his
views on hotel keeping, he had spent all his life, and
there he sincerely hoped to die full of honour and good
nourishment. Brantôme contented him. It belonged
to him. It was so diminutive and compact that he
could take the whole of it in at once. He was familiar
with all the little tragedies and comedies that enacted
themselves beneath those red-tiled roofs. Did
he walk down the Rue de Périgueux his hand went
to his hat as often as that of the President of the Republic
on his way to a review at Longchamps. He
was a man of substance and consideration, and he
was just forty years of age. And Félise adored him,
and anticipated his commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She returned with the letter. He glanced through
it, reading portions aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sending you a young couple whom I have
taken to my heart. They are not relations, they are
not married and they are not lovers. They are Arcadians
of the pavement, more innocent than doves,
and of a ferocious English morality. She is a painter
without patrons, he a professor without classes. They
are also candidates for happiness performing their
novitiate. Later they will take the vows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he mean? What vows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they are pious people and are going to
enter the convent,” Félise suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see your father—anti-clerical that he is—interesting
himself in little nuns and monks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet he and Monsieur le Curé are good friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is because Monsieur le Curé has much wisdom
and no fear. He would have tried to convert
Voltaire himself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let us continue——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As they are poor and doing this out of obedience——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Saprelotte!</span>” he laughed, “they seem to have taken
the three vows already!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He read on:“—— they do not desire the royal suite
in your Excelsior Palace. Corinna Hastings has lived
under the roofs in Paris, Martin Overshaw over a
baker’s shop in a vague quarter of London. All the
luxury they ask is to be allowed to wash themselves
all over in cold water once a day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sure you had not written to my father about
the bathroom,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was right. But the omission was odd. For
Bigourdin took inordinate pride in the newly installed
bathroom and all the touring clubs of Europe and Editors
of Guide Books had heard of it and he had offered
it to the admiring inspection of half Brantôme.
Monsieur le Maire himself had visited it, and if he
had only arrived girt with his tricolour sash, Bigourdin
would have jumped in and demanded an inaugural
ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must have forgotten,” said Bigourdin. “But no
matter. They can have plenty of cold water. But
if I am to feed them and lodge them and wash them
for the derisory price your father stipulates, they must
learn that six o’clock is the hour of table d’hôte at
the Hôtel des Grottes. It is only people in automobiles
who can turn the place upside down, and then
they have to pay four francs for their dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose mountainously, and, standing, displayed the
figure of a vigorous, huge proportioned, upright man.
On his face, large and ruddy, a small black moustache
struck a startling note. His eyes were brown and
kindly, his mouth too small and his chin had a deep
cleft, which on a creature of lesser scale would have
been a pleasing dimple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Allons dîner</span>,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the patriarchal fashion, now unfortunately becoming
obsolete, Monsieur Bigourdin dined with his
guests. The <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>—off the loggia—was furnished
with the long central table sacred to commercial
travellers, and with a few side tables for other visitors.
At one of these, in the corner between the service
door and the dining-room door, sat Monsieur
Bigourdin and his niece. As they entered the room
five bagmen, with anticipatory napkins stuck cornerwise
in their collars, half rose from their chairs and
bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bon soir, messieurs</span>,” said Bigourdin, and he
passed with Félise to his table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Euphémie, the cook, fat and damp, entered with
the soup tureen, followed by a desperate-looking, crop-headed
villain bearing plates. The latter, who viewed
half a mile off through a telescope might have passed
for an orthodox waiter, appeared, at close quarters,
to be raimented in grease and grime. He served the
soup; first to the five commercial travellers,—and then
to Bigourdin and Félise. On Félise’s plate he left a
great thumb-mark. She looked at it with an expression
of disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Regarde, mon oncle.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin alluding to him as a sacred animal, asked
what she could expect. He was from Bourdeilles, a
place of rocks some five miles distant, condemned by
Brantôme, chef-lieu du Canton. He summoned him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Polydore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oui, monsieur.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have made a mistake. You are no longer in
the hands of the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Monsieur veut dire——?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not the Commissaire who desires to photograph
your finger-prints.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, pardon,” said Polydore, and with a soiled napkin
he erased the offending stain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sacré animal!</span>” repeated Bigourdin, attacking his
soup. “I wonder why I keep him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I too,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If his grandmother and my grandmother had not
been foster-sisters——” said Bigourdin, waving an
indignant spoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would have kept him just because he is ugly,”
smiled Félise. “You would have found a reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of these days I’ll throw him into the river,”
Bigourdin declared. “I am patient. I am slow to
anger. But when I am roused I am like a lion. Polydore,”
said he serenely, as the dilapidated menial removed
the plates, “if you can’t keep your hands clean
I’ll make you wear gloves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People would laugh at me,” said Polydore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better,” said Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meal was nearly over when the expected guests
were announced. Uncle and niece slipped from the
dining room into the little vestibule to welcome them.
An elderly man in a blouse, name Baptiste, was already
busying himself with their luggage—the knapsacks
fastened to the back of the bicycles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle, Monsieur,” said Bigourdin, “it is a
great pleasure to me to meet friends of my excellent
brother-in-law. Allow me to present Mademoiselle
Félise Fortinbras” (he gave the French pronunciation),
“my niece. As dinner is not yet over and as you
must be hungry, will you give yourselves the trouble
to enter the <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to have a wash first,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin glanced at Félise. They were beginning
early.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a bathroom upstairs fitted with every modern
luxury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna laughed. “I only want to tidy up a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will show you to your room,” said Félise, and
conducted her up the staircase beside the bureau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And monsieur?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went over to the little lavabo against the
wall beside which hung the usual damp towel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will do quite well,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin breathed again. The new arrivals were
quite human; and they spoke French perfectly. The
men conversed a while until the two girls descended.
Bigourdin led his guests into the <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span> and
installed them at a table by one of the windows looking
on the loggia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like this,” said he, “you will be cool and also enjoy
the view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Corinna, looking up at him, “you
have the most delicious little town I have seen in
France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin’s eyes beamed with gratification. He
bowed and went back to his unfinished meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold over there,” said he to Félise, “a young
girl of extraordinary good sense. She is also extremely
pretty; a combination which is rare in
women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, uncle,” said Félise demurely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The five commercial travellers rose, and, bowing
as they passed their host, went out in search, after
the manner of their kind, of coffee and backgammon
at the Café de l’Univers in the Rue de Périgueux. It
is only foreigners who linger over coffee, liqueurs
and tobacco in the little inns of France. Presently
Félise went off to the bureau to make up the day’s
accounts, and Bigourdin, having smoked a thoughtful
cigarette, crossed over to Martin and Corinna. After
the good hotel-keeper’s enquiry as to their gastronomic
satisfaction, he swept his hand through his inch-high
standing stubble of black hair, and addressed
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Over—Oversh—forgive me if I cannot
pronounce your name——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Overshaw,” said Martin distinctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Auvershaud—Auverchat—<span class='it'>non—c’est bigrement
difficile</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then call me Monsieur Martin, <span class='it'>à la française</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And me, Mademoiselle Corinne,” laughed Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Voilà!</span>” cried Bigourdin, delighted. “Those are
names familiar to every Frenchman.” Then his brow
clouded. “Well, Monsieur Martin, there is something
I would say to you. What profession does my
good brother-in-law exercise in Paris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin and Corinna exchanged glances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I scarcely know,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is on account of my niece, his daughter, that I
ask. You permit me to sit down for a moment?” He
drew a chair. “You must understand at once,” said
he, “that I have nothing against Monsieur Fortinbras.
I love him like myself. But, on the other hand, I also
love my little niece. She is very simple, very innocent,
and does not appreciate the subtleties of the great
world. She adores her father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can quite understand that,” said Martin, “and I
am sure that he adores her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely,” said Bigourdin. “That is why I would
like you to have no doubt as to the profession of my
brother-in-law. You have never, by any chance,
Mademoiselle Corinne, heard him called ‘<span class='it'>Le Marchand
de Bonheur</span>’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never,” said Corinna, meeting his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never,” echoed Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even when he advised you to come here? It
is for Félise that I ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have heard that he is an <span class='it'>avoué</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An English solicitor practising in Paris. Of
course,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very clever solicitor,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin smote his chest with his great hand. “I
thank you with all my heart for your understanding.
You are the first persons she has met who know her
father—it is somewhat embarrassing, what I say—and
she, in her innocence, will ask you questions, which
he did not foresee——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be no difficulty in answering them,”
replied Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Encore merci</span>,” said Bigourdin. “You must know
that Félise came to us at five years old, when my
poor wife was living—she died ten years ago—I am a
widower. She is to me like my own daughter. Although,”
he added, with a smile and a touch of vanity,
“I am not quite so old as that. My sister, her
mother, is older than I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is alive then?” asked Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” replied Bigourdin. “Did you not know
that? But she has been an invalid for many years.
That is why Félise lives here instead of with her
parents. I hope, Mademoiselle, you and she will be
good friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure we shall,” replied Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little while later the two wanderers sat over their
coffee by the balustrade of the covered loggia and
looked out on the velvet night, filled with contentment.
They had reached their goal. Here they were
to stay until it pleased Fortinbras to come and direct
them afresh. Hitherto, their resting-places, mere
stages on their journey, had lacked the atmosphere
of permanence. The still nights when they had
talked together, as now, beneath the stars, had
throbbed with a certain fever, the anticipation of the
morrow’s dawn, the morrow’s adventures in strange
lands. But now they had come to their destined
haven. Here they would remain to-morrow, and the
morrow after that, and for morrows indefinite. A
phase of their life had ended with curious suddenness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the intensity of silence falls on ears accustomed
to the whirr of machinery, so did an intensity
of peace encompass their souls. And the dim-lit
valley itself brought solace. Not here stretched infinite
horizons such as those of the plains of La Beauce
through which they had passed, horizons whence
sprang a whole hemisphere of stars, horizons which
embracing nothing set the heart aching for infinite
things beyond, horizons in the centre of which they
stood specks of despair overwhelmed by immensities.
Here the comfortable land had taken them to its
bosom. Near enough to be felt, the vague bluish
mass of the Limousin mountains sweeping from north
to east assured them of the calm protection of eternal
forces. Beyond them who need look or crave to
look? To the fevered spirit they brought in their
mothering shelter all that was needed by man for
his happiness: fruitfulness of cornfields, mystery of
beech-woods faintly revealed by the rays of a young
moon, a quiet town for man’s untroubled habitation,
guarded by its encircling river, rather guessed than
seen and betrayed only here and there by a streak of
quivering light. And as the distant glare of great
cities—the lights of London reflected in the heavens—in
the days of wandering youths seeking their fortunes,
compelled them moth-like to the focus, so in
its dreamy microcosm did the lights of the little
town, a thousand flickering points from the outskirts
and a line of long illumination marking the main
street athwart the dark mass of roofs and dissipating
itself hazily in midair, appeal to the imagination—set
it wondering as to the myriad joyous affairs of
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In low voices they talked of Fortinbras. His spirit
seemed to have emerged from the welter of Paris into
this pool of the world’s tranquillity. In spite of his
magnetic force his words had been but words. What
they were to meet at Brantôme they knew not. They
scarce had thought. What to them had been the
landlord of a tiny provincial inn but a good-natured
common fellow unworthy of speculation? And what
the daughter of the seedy Paris Bohemian, snapper
up of unconsidered trifles, but a serving girl of no
account, plain and redolent of the scullery? Bigourdin’s
courteous bearing and delicacy of speech had
come upon them as a surprise. So had the refinement
of Félise. They had to readjust their conception of
Fortinbras. They were amazed, simple souls, to find
that he had ties in life so indubitably respectable.
And he had a wife, too, a chronic invalid, with whom
he lived in the jealous obscurity of Paris. It was
pathetic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They had obeyed him hardly knowing
why. At the back of their minds he had been but a
charlatan of peculiar originality—at the same time a
being almost mythical, so remote from them was his
life. And now he became startlingly real. They
heard his voice soft and persuasive whispering by
their side with a touch of gentle mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then silence fell upon them; their minds drifted
apart and they lost themselves in their separate
dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, Polydore coming to remove the coffee tray
and to enquire as to their further wants, broke the
spell. When he had gone, Corinna leaned her elbow
on the little iron table and asked in her direct fashion:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you been thinking of, Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew his hand across his eyes, and it was a
moment or two before he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was in London,” said he, “I seem to have
lived in a tiny provincial town. Now that I come
to a tiny provincial town I have an odd feeling that
the deep life of a great city is before me. That’s the
best I can do by way of explanation. Thoughts like
that are a bit formless and elusive, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think you’re going to find here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Why not happiness in some form
or other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You expect a lot for five francs,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, what have you been thinking of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed, and in the gloom he followed the direction
of white-bloused arm and white hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you see that little house on the quay? The
one with the lights and the loggia. You can just get
a glimpse of the interior. See? There’s a picture
and below a woman sitting at a piano. If you listen
you can catch the sound. It’s Schubert’s ‘Moment
Musical.’ Well, I’ve been wishing I were that woman
with her life full of her home and husband and
children. Sheltered—protected—love all around her—nothing
more to ask of God. It was a beautiful
dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You too,” said Martin, “feel about this place
somewhat as I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it’s the night. It turns one into a sentimental
lunatic. Fancy living here for the rest of
one’s days and concentrating one’s soul on human
stomachs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Corinna?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that what woman’s domestic life comes to?
She must fill her husband’s stomach properly or he’ll
beat her or run off with somebody else, and she must
fill her babies’ stomachs properly or they’ll get cramps
and convulsions and bilious attacks and die. It was a
beautiful dream. But the reality would drive me stick,
stark, staring mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My ideas of married life,” said Martin sagely,
“are quite different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course!” she cried. “You’re one of the creatures
with the stomach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never been aware of it,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It strikes me you’re too good for this world,” said
Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin rolled a cigarette from a brown packet of
Maryland tobacco—his supply of English ‘Woodbines’
had long since given out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have my ideals as to love—and so forth,” said
he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so have I. ‘All for Love and the World Well
Lost.’ That’s the title of an old play, isn’t it? I can
understand it. I would give my soul for it. But it
happens once in a blue moon. Meanwhile one has to
live. And connubiality and maternity in a little lost
hole in Nowhere like this aren’t life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the dickens is life?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her definition he did not hear, for the vast figure
of Bigourdin loomed in the doorway of the <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you good night,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin rose and looked at his watch. “I think it’s
time to go to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” yawned Corinna.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span><h1>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> first thing a cat does on taking up its quarters
in a new home is to make itself acquainted
with its surroundings. It walks methodically
with uplifted tail and quivering nose from vast monument
of sideboard to commonplace of chair, from glittering
palisade of fender to long lying bastion of
couch, creeps by defences of walls noting each comfortable
issue, prowls through lanes and squares innumerable
formed by intricacies of furniture; and
having once gone through the grave business, worries
its head no more about topography and points
of interests, but settles down to serene enjoyment of
such features of the place as have appealed to its
æsthetic or grosser instincts. In this respect the
average human is nearer a cat than he cares to realise.
The first hour on board a strange ship is generally
devoted to an exhaustive exploration never
repeated during the rest of the voyage, and doubtless
a prisoner’s first act on being locked into his cell is
to creep round the confined space and familiarise himself
with his depressing installation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Obeying this instinct common to cats and men, Martin
and Corinna, as soon as they had finished breakfast
the next morning, wandered forth and explored Brantôme.
They visited the grey remains of the old abbey
begun by Charlemagne. But Villon writing in the 15th
Century and asking “<span class='it'>Mais où est le preux Charlemaigne?</span>”
might have asked with equal sense of the
transitory nature of human things: “Where is the
Abbey which the knightly Charlemagne did piously
build in Brantôme?” For the Normans came and destroyed
it and one eleventh-century tower protecting
a Romanesque Gothic church alone tells where the abbey
stood. Strolling down to the river level along the
dusty, shady road, they came to the terraced hill-side,
past which the river once infinitely furious must have
torn its way. In the sheer rock were doors of human
dwellings, numbered sedately like the houses of a smug
row. Above them, at the height of a cottage roof,
stretched a grassy plain, from which, corresponding
with each homestead, emerged the short stump of a
chimney emitting thin smoke from the hearth beneath.
Before one of the open doors they halted. Children
were playing in the one room which made up the entire
habitation. They had the impression of a vague
bed in the gloom, a table, a chair or two, cooking utensils
by the rude chimney-piece, bunks fitted into the
living rock at the sides. The children might have been
Peter Pan and Wendy and Michael and John and the
rest of the delectable company, and the chimney-stump
above them might have been replaced by
Michael’s silk hat, and on the green sward around it
pirates and Red Indians might have fought undetected
by the happy denizens below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus announced Corinna with lighter fancy. But
Martin, serious exponent of truth, explained that the
monks, in the desolate times when their Abbey was
rebuilding had hewn out these abodes for cells and had
dwelt in them many many years; and to prove it, having
conferred, before her descent to breakfast, with
the excellent Monsieur Bigourdin, he led her to a
neighbouring cave, called in the district, Les Grottes—Hence
the name of Bigourdin’s hotel—which the good
monks, their pious aspiration far exceeding their powers
of artistic execution, had adorned with grotesque
and primitive carvings in bas-relief, representing the
Last Judgment and the Crucifixion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They paused to admire the Renaissance Fontaine
Médicis, set in startling contrast against the rugged
background of rock, with its graceful balustrade and
its medallion enclosing the bust of the worthy Pierre
de Bourdeille, Abbé de Brantôme, the immortal chronicler
of horrific scandals; and they crossed the Pont
des Barris, and wandered by the quays where men
angled patiently for deriding fish, and women below
at the water’s edge beat their laundry with lusty arms;
and so past the row of dwellings old and new huddled
together, a decaying thirteenth-century house
with its heavy corbellings and a bit of rounded turret
lost in the masonry jostling a perky modern café
decked with iron balconies painted green, until they
came to the end of the bridge that commands the main
entrance to the tiny water-girt town. They plunged
into it with childlike curiosity. In the Rue de Périgueux
they stood entranced before the shop fronts of
that wondrous thoroughfare alive with the traffic of
an occasional ox-cart, a rusty one-horse omnibus labelled
“<span class='it'>Service de Ville</span>” and some prehistoric automobile
wheezing by, a clattering impertinence. For
there were shops in Brantôme of fair pretension—is
it not the <span class='it'>chef lieu du Canton</span>?—and you could buy
<span class='it'>articles de Paris</span> at most three years old. And there
was a Pharmacie Internationale, so called because
there you could obtain Pear’s soap and Eno’s Fruit
salt; and a draper’s where were exposed for sale frilleries
which struck Martin as marvellous, but at which
Corinna curved a supercilious lip; and a shop ambitiously
blazoned behind whose plate-glass windows
could be seen a porcelain bath-tub and other adjuncts
of the luxurious bathroom, on one of which, sole occupant
of the establishment, a little pig-tailed girl was
seated eating from a porringer on her knees; and there
were all kinds of other shops including one which sold
cabbages and salsifies and charcoal and petrol and picture
postcards and rusty iron and vintage eggs and
guano and all manner of fantastic dirt. And there was
the Librairie de la Dordogne which smiled at you when
you asked for devotional pictures or tin-tacks, but
gasped when you demanded books. Martin and Corinna,
however, demanded them with British insensibility
and marched away with an armful of cheap reprints
of French classics disinterred from a tomb beneath
the counter. But before they went, Martin
asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But have you nothing new? Nothing from Paris
that has just appeared?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Voici, monsieur</span>,” replied the elderly proprietress
of the Library of the Dordogne, plucking a volume
from a speckled shelf at the back of the shop. “<span class='it'>On
trouve ça très joli.</span>” And she handed him <span class='it'>Le Maître
de Forges</span>, by Georges Ohnet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this, madam,” said Martin, examining the venerable
unsold copy, “was published in 1882.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I regret, monsieur,” said the lady, “we have nothing
more recent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll buy it if it breaks me—as a curiosity,” cried
Corinna, and she counted out two francs, seventy-five
centimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ninety-five,” said the bookseller—she was speckled
and dusty and colourless like the back of her
library——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in Paris——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Paris it is different, mademoiselle. We are here
<span class='it'>en province</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna added the extra twopence and went out
with Martin, grasping her prize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the deliciousest place in the world,” she
laughed. “Eighteen eighty-two! Why, that’s years
before I was born!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what on earth are we going to do for books
here?” Martin asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is always the railway station,” said Corinna.
“And if you kiss the old lady at the bookstall nicely,
she will get you anything you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ways of provincial France,” said Martin, “take
a good deal of finding out!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Thus began their first day in Brantôme. It ended
peacefully. Another day passed and yet another and
many more, and they lived in lotus land. Soon after
their arrival came their luggage from Paris, and they
were enabled to change the aspect of the road-worn
vagabond for that of neat suburban English folk and
as such gained the approbation of the small community.
They had little else to do but continue to
repeat their exploration. In their unadventurous wanderings
Félise sometimes accompanied them and shyly
spoke her halting English. To Corinna alone she could
chatter with quaint ungrammatical fluency; but in
Martin’s presence she blushed confusedly at every
broken sentence. All her young life she had lived in
her mother’s land and spoken her mother’s tongue.
She had a vague notion that legally she was English,
and she took mighty pride in it, but by training and
mental habit she was the little French bourgeoise,
through and through. With Martin alone, however,
she abandoned all attempts at English, and gradually
her shyness disappeared. She gave the first signs of
confidence by speaking of her mother in Paris as of
a dream woman of wonderful excellencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see her often, mademoiselle?” Martin asked
politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! no, Monsieur Martin.” She shook her head
sadly and gazed into the distance. They were idling
on one of the bridges while Corinna a few feet away
made a rapid sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes. He comes four times a year. It is not
that I do not love him. <span class='it'>J’adore papa.</span> Every one does.
You cannot help it. But it is not the same thing. A
mother——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, mademoiselle,” said Martin. “My mother
died a few months ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with quick tenderness. “That
must have caused you much pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mademoiselle,” said Martin simply, and he
smiled for the first time into her eyes, realising quite
suddenly that beneath them lay deep wells of sympathy
and understanding. “Perhaps one of these days you
will let me talk to you about her,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flushed. “Why, yes. Talking relieves the
heart.” She used the French word “<span class='it'>soulager</span>”—that
word of deep-mouthed comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does. And your mother, Mademoiselle Félise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She cannot walk,” she sighed. “All these years
she has lain on her bed—ever since I left her when I
was quite little. So you see, she cannot come to see
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you might go to Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not travel much in Brantôme,” replied
Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you have not seen her——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But I remember her. She was so beautiful
and so tender—she had chestnut hair. My father
says she has not changed at all. And she writes to
me every week, Monsieur Martin. And there she lies
day after day, always suffering, but always sweet and
patient and never complaining. She is an angel.”
After a little pause, she raised her face to him—“But
here am I talking of my mother, when you asked
me to let you talk of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin then and on many occasions afterwards
spoke to her of one that was dead more intimately
than he could speak to Corinna, who seemed impatient
of the expression of simple emotions. Corinna
he would never have allowed to see tears come into
his eyes; but with Félise it did not matter. Her own
eyes filled too in sympathy. And this was the beginning
of a quiet understanding between them. Perhaps
it might have been the beginning of something
deeper on Martin’s side had not Bigourdin taken an
early opportunity of expounding certain matrimonial
schemes of his own with regard to Félise. It had all
been arranged, said he, many years ago. His good
neighbour, Monsieur Viriot, <span class='it'>marchand de vins en gros</span>—oh,
a man everything there was of the most solid,
had an only son; and he, Bigourdin, had an only niece
for whom he had set apart a substantial dowry. A
hundred thousand francs. There were not many girls
in Brantôme who could hide as much as that in their
bridal veils. It was the most natural thing in the
world that Lucien should marry Félise—nay, more,
an ordinance of the <span class='it'>bon Dieu</span>. Lucien had been absent
some time doing his military service. That would
soon be over. He would enter his father’s business.
The formal demand in marriage would be made and
they would celebrate the <span class='it'>fiançailles</span> before the end of
the year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Mademoiselle Félise care for Lucien?” asked
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin shrugged his mountainous shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He does not displease her. What more do we
want? She is a good little girl, and knows that she
can entrust her happiness to my hands. And Lucien
is a capital fellow. They will be very happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he warned a sensitive Martin off philandering
paths, and, with his French adroitness, separated youth
and maiden as much as possible. And this was not
difficult. You see Félise acted as manageress in the
Hôtel des Grottes, and her activities were innumerable.
There was the kitchen to be ruled, an eye to
be kept on the handle of the basket—if it danced too
much, according to the French phrase, the cook was
exceeding her commission of a sou in the franc; there
were the bedrooms and clean dry linen to be seen to,
and the doings of Polydore, the unclean, and of Baptiste,
the haphazard, to be watched; there were daily
bills to be made out, accounts to be balanced, impatient
bagmen to be cajoled or rebuked; orders for <span class='it'>pâté
de foie gras</span> and truffles to be despatched—the Hôtel
des Grottes had a famous manufactory of these delights
and during autumn and winter supported a
hive of workers and the shelves in the cool store-house
were filled with appetising jars; and then the laundry
and the mending and the polishing of the famous bathroom—<span class='it'>ma
foi</span>, there was enough to keep one small
manageress busy. Like a <span class='it'>bon hôtelier</span>, Bigourdin himself
supervised all these important matters, ordering
and controlling, as an administrator, but Félise was
the executive. And like an obedient and happy little
executive Félise did not notice a subtle increase in her
duties. Nor did Martin, honest soul, in whose eyes
a betrothed maiden was as sacred as a married woman,
remark any change in facilities of intercourse. For
him she flashed, a gracious figure, across the half real
tapestry of his present life. A kindly word, a smiling
glance, on passing, sufficed for the maintenance of his
pleasant understanding with Félise. For feminine
companionship of a stimulating kind, there was always
Corinna. For masculine society he had Bigourdin
and his cronies of the Café de l’Univers, to whom
he was introduced in his professorial dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was there, at the café table, in the midst of the
notables of the little town, that he learned many things
either undreamed of or uncared for during his narrow
life at Margett’s Universal College. It startled
him to find himself in the company of men passionately
patriotic. Hitherto, as an Englishman living remote
from Continental thought, he had taken patriotism
for granted; his interest in politics had been mild
and parochial; he had adopted a vague conservative
outlook due, most likely, to antipathy to his democratic
Swiss relatives, who sent eight pounds to the relief of
his impoverished mother, and to a nervous shrinking
from democracy in general as represented by his pupils.
But in this backwater of the world he encountered a
political spirit intensely alive. Vital principles formed
the subject of easy, yet stern discussion. Beneath the
calm of peaceful commerce and agriculture he felt the
pulse of France throbbing in fierce determination to
maintain her national existence. Every man had been
a soldier; some of the elders had fought in 1870, and
those who had grown up sons were the fathers of
soldiers. Martin realised that whereas in England,
in time of peace, the private soldier was tolerated as
a picturesque, good-natured, harum-scarum sort of fellow,
the <span class='it'>picu-piou</span> in France was an object of universal
affection. The army was woven into the whole
web of French life; it permeated the whole of French
thought; it coloured the whole of French sentiment.
It was not a machine of blood and iron, as in Germany,
but the soul sacrifice of a nation. “<span class='it'>Vive la France!</span>”
meant “<span class='it'>Vive l’armée!</span>” And that mere expression
“<span class='it'>Vive la France!</span>”—how often had he heard it during
his short sojourn in the country. He cudgelled his
brains to remember when he had heard a corresponding
cry in England. It seemed to him that there was
none. There was no need for one. England would
live as long as the sea girded her shores and Britannia
ruled the waves. We need not trouble our English
heads any further. But in France conditions are different.
From the Vosges to the Bay of Biscay, from
Calais to the Mediterranean, every stroke on a Krupp
anvil reverberated through France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ça vient</span>—when no one knows,” said the comfortable
citizens, “but it is coming sooner or later, and
then we shed the last drop of our blood. We are prepared.
We have learned our lesson. There will never
be another Sedan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said it soberly, like men whose eyes were set
on an implacable foe. And Martin knew that through
the length and breadth of the land comfortable citizens
held the same sober and stern discourse. Every inch
of French soil was dear to these men, and to guard it
they would shed the last drop of their blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna informed of these conversations said
lightly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t lived among them as long as I have.
It’s just their Gallic way of talking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martin knew better. His horizons were expanding.
He began, too, to conceive a curious love
for a country so earnest, whose speech was the first
that he had spoken. He had a vague impression that
he was learning to live a corporate, instead of an individual
life. When he tried to interpret these feelings
to Corinna she cried out upon him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To hear you talk one would think you hadn’t any
English blood. Isn’t England good enough for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s because I’m beginning to understand France
that I’m beginning to understand England,” he replied
in his grave way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like practising on the maid before you dare make
love to the mistress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very possibly,” said he, digging the blunt end of
his fork into the coarse salt—they were at lunch. “To
put it another way—if you learn Latin you learn the
structure of all languages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a regular schoolmaster’s simile,” she remarked,
scornfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flushed. “I’m no longer a schoolmaster,” said
he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since when?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since I came here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say you’re not going back to it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused before replying to the sudden question
which accident had occasioned. To himself he had
put it many times of late, but hitherto had evaded a
definite answer. Now, with a thrill, he looked at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid down her knife and fork and stared at him.
Was he, after all, taking this fool journey seriously?
To her it had been a reckless adventure, a stolen trip
into lotus-land, with the knowledge of an inevitable return
to common earth eating into her heart. Even now
she dreaded to ask how much of her twenty pounds
had been spent. But she knew that the day of doom
was approaching. She could not live without money.
Neither could he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you propose to do for a living?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows,” said he. “I don’t. Anyhow, the
squirrel has escaped from his cage, and he’s not going
back to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s he going to do? Sit on a tree and eat nuts?
Oh, my dear Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are worse fates,” he replied, answering her
laughter with a smile. “At any rate, he has God’s
free universe all around him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all very well; but analogies are futile. You
aren’t a squirrel and you can’t live on acorns and east
wind. You must live on bread and beef. How are
you going to get them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get them somehow,” said he. “I’m waiting for
Fortinbras.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this determination had he come after three weeks
residence in Brantôme. The poor-spirited drudge had
drunk of the waters of life and was a drudge no more.
He had passed into another world. Far remote, as
down the clouded vista of long memory, he saw the
bare, hopeless class room and the pale, pinched faces
of the students. All that belonged to a vague past. It
had no concern with the present or the future. How
he had arrived at this state of being he could not tell.
The change had been wrought little by little, day by
day. The ten years of his servitude had been blocked
out. He had the thrilling sense of starting life afresh
at thirty, as he had started it, a boy of twenty. There
was so much more in the open world than he had
dreamed of. If the worst came to the worst he could
go forth into it, knapsack on shoulders and seek his
fortune; and every step he took would carry him further
from Margett’s Universal College.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When is that fraud of a <span class='it'>marchand de bonheur</span> coming?”
Corinna cried impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put the question to Bigourdin the next time
she met him alone—which was after the meal, on the
<span class='it'>terrasse</span>. He could not tell. Perhaps to-night, to-morrow,
the week after next. Fortinbras came and went
like the wind, without warning. Did Mademoiselle
Corinne desire his arrival so much?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to see him here before I go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before you go? You are leaving us, Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed at his look of dismay. “I can’t stay
idling here for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have been here no time at all,” said he.
“Just a little bird that comes and perches on this balustrade,
looks this side and that side out of its bright
eyes and then flies away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oui, c’est comme ça</span>,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Voilà!</span>” He sighed and turned to throw his broad-brimmed
hat on a neighbouring table. “That’s the
worst of our infamous trade of hotel keeping. You
meet sincere and candid souls whose friendship you
crave, but before you have time to win it, away they
go like the little bird, for ever and ever out of your
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have won my friendship, Monsieur Bigourdin,”
said Corinna, with rising colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very gracious, Mademoiselle Corinne. But
why take it from me as soon as it is given?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t,” she retorted. “I shall always remember
you and your kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Aïe, aïe!</span> You know our saying: <span class='it'>Tout passe, tout
casse, tout lasse</span>. It is the way of the world, the way
of humanity. We say that we will remember—but
other things come to dim memory, to blunt sentiment—<span class='it'>enfin</span>,
we forget, not because we want to, but because
we must.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we must,” laughed Corinna, “you’ll forget our
friendship too. So we’ll be quits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, mademoiselle,” he cried illogically. “Your
friendship will always be precious to me. You came
into this dull house with your youth, your freshness,
your wit and your charm—different from the ordinary
hotel guest you have joined my little intimate family
life—Félise, for example adores you—were it not for
her mother, you would be her ideal. And I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Monsieur Bigourdin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice had the flat sound of a wooden mallet
striking a peg. The huge man bowed with considerable
dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall miss terribly all that you have brought into
this house, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna relaxed into a mocking smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fortinbras warned us that you were a poet, Monsieur
Bigourdin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every honest man whose eyes can see the beautiful
things of life must be a poet of a kind. It is not necessary
to scribble verses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do you? Do you write verse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Jamais de la vie</span>” he declared stoutly. “An <span class='it'>hôtelier</span>
like me count syllables on his fingers? <span class='it'>Ah, non!</span> I
can make excellent pâté de foie gras—no one better in
Périgord—but I should make execrable verses. <span class='it'>Ah,
voyons donc!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed lustily and Corinna laughed too; and
Martin, appearing on the verandah, asked and learned
the reason of their mirth. After a word or two their
host left them fanning himself with his great hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth brought you here?” said Corinna.
“I was having the flirtation of my life.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span> <span class='sc'>WEEK</span> passed and Fortinbras did not come.
Corinna wrote to him. He replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have patience, cultivate Martin’s sense of
humour and make Félise give you lessons in domestic
economy. The cook might instruct you in the various
processes whereby eggs are rendered edible and you
might also learn how to launder clothes without disaster
to flesh or linen. I am afraid you are wasting
your time. Remember you’re not like Martin who
needs this rest to get his soul into proper condition.
I will come whither my heart draws me—for I yearn
to see my little Félise—as soon as I am allowed to do
so by my manifold avocations and responsibilities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna, in a fury, handed the letter to Martin and
asked him what he thought of it. He replied that,
in his opinion, Fortinbras gave excellent advice. Corinna
declared Fortinbras to be an overbearing and sarcastic
pig and rated Martin for standing by and seeing
her insulted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gave him five francs for putting you on the
road to happiness,” he replied. “He has done his best,
and seems to keep on doing it—without extra charge.
I think you ought to be grateful. His suggestions are
full of sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound his suggestions,” cried Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think our friend Bigourdin would be pleased if
you followed them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see what our friend Bigourdin has to do
with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would give you all the help he could. A Frenchman
likes a woman to know how to do things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t wash clothes,” said Corinna defiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might rise superior to a brand of soap,” retorted
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her back on him and went her way. His
gross sense of humour required no cultivation. It was
a poisonous weed. And what did he mean by dragging
in Bigourdin? She would never speak to Martin
again, after his disgraceful innuendo. It took the flavour
from the sympathetic relations that had been set
up between her host and herself during the past week.
A twinge of conscience exacerbated her anger against
Martin. She certainly had encouraged Bigourdin to
fuller professions of friendship than is usual between
landlord and guest. The fresh flowers he had laid by
her plate at every meal she wore in her dress. Only
the night before she had ever so delicately hinted that
Martin was capable of visiting the Café de l’Univers
without a bear-leader, and the huge and poetical man
had sat with her in the moonlight and in terms of
picturesque philosophy had exposed to her the barren
loneliness of his soul. She had enjoyed the evening
prodigiously, and was looking forward to other evenings
equally exhilarating. Now Martin had spoiled
it all. She called Martin names that would have
shocked Mrs. Hastings and caused her father to mention
her specially during family prayers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she defended herself proudly. Who was there
to talk to in that Nowhere of a place? The conversation
of Félise stimulated as much as that of a ten-year-old
child. Martin she had sucked dry as a bone
during their seven weeks companionship. He of course
could hob-nob with men at the café. He also had
picked up a curious assortment of acquaintance, male
and female in the town, and had acquired a knack of
conversing with them. A day or two ago she had
come upon him in one of the rock dwellings discussing
politics with a desperate villain who worked in the
freestone quarries, while the frowsy mistress of the
house lavished on him smiles and the horrible grey
wine of the country which he drank out of a bowl.
She, Corinna, had no café; nor could she find anything
in common with desperadoes of quarrymen and
their frowsy wives; to enter their houses savoured of
district visiting, a philanthropic practice which she
abhorred with all the abhorrence of a parson’s rebellious
daughter. Where was she to look for
satisfying human intercourse? She knew enough
of the French middle-class manners and customs to be
aware that she might live in Brantôme a thousand
years before one lady would call on her—a mere question
of social code as to which she had no cause for
resentment. But she craved the stimulus, the give-and-take
of talk, such as had been her daily food in Paris
for the last three years. Huge, not at all commonplace,
but somewhat of an enigma, Bigourdin lumbered
on to her horizon. His first-hand knowledge of men
and things was confined to Brantôme and Lyons. But
with that knowledge he had pierced deep and wide.
He had read little but astonishingly. He had a grasp
of European, even of English internal affairs that
disconcerted Corinna, who airily set out to expound to
him the elements of world politics. Two phases of
French poetry formed an essential factor of his intellectual
life—the Fifteenth Century Amorists, and the
later romanticists. He could quote Victor Hugo, Alfred
de Musset, Théodore de Banville by the mile.
When stirred he had in his voice disquieting tones. He
recited the “<span class='it'>Chanson de Fortunio</span>” and the “<span class='it'>Chanson
de Barberine</span>” in the moonlight, and Corinna caught
her breath and felt a shiver down her spine. It was
a new sensation for Corinna to feel shivers down her
spine at the sound of a man’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to bed with the words singing in her ears
like music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altogether it was much more comforting to talk
to Bigourdin than to take lessons in household management
from Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the day came when she plucked up courage
and demanded of Martin an account of his stewardship.
He tried to evade the task by flourishing in her face
a bundle of notes. They had heaps, said he, to go on
with. But Corinna pressed her enquiry with feminine
insistence. Had he kept any memoranda of expenditure?
Of course methodical Martin had done so.
Where was it? Reluctantly he drew a soiled note book
from his pocket and side by side at a little table on
the verandah, her fair hair brushing his dark cheek,
they added up the figures and apportioned and divided
and eventually struck the balance. Corinna was
one franc seventy-five centimes in Martin’s debt. She
had not one penny in the world. She had one franc
seventy-five centimes less than nothing. She rose
white-lipped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to have told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Martin. “There’s plenty of money
in the common stock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There never was any such thing as a common
stock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought there was,” said Martin. “I thought
we had arranged it with Fortinbras. Anyhow, there’s
one now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t,” she cried indignantly. “Do you suppose
I’m going to live on your money? What kind of
a girl do you take me for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An unconventional one,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not dishonourable. To assert my freedom and
live by myself in Paris and run about France alone
with you may be unconventional. But for a girl
to accept support from a man when—when she
gives him nothing in return—is a different thing altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They argued for some time, and at the end of the
argument neither was convinced. She upbraided.
Martin ought to have struck a daily balance. He continued
to put forward the plea of the common stock
to which she had apparently given her tacit agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said Martin at last, “there’s no dishonour
in a loan. You can give me an I.O.U. That’s
a legal document.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how do you suppose I am ever going to pay
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, my dear Corinna,” said he, “is a matter
which doesn’t interest me in the least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned on him furiously. “Do you know what
you are? Would you like me to tell you? You’re
the most utterly selfish man in the wide, wide world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flung away through the empty <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>,
and left Martin questioning the eternal hills of the
Limousin. “I offer,” said he, in effect, “to share my
last penny, in all honour and comradeship, with a
young person of the opposite sex whom I have always
treated with the utmost delicacy, who is absolutely
nothing to me, who would scoff at the idea of marrying
me and whom I would no more think of marrying
than a Fifth of November box of fireworks, who has
heaped on me all sorts of contumelious epithets—I
offer, I repeat, to divide my last crust with her, and
she calls me selfish. Eternal hills, resolve the problem.”
But the hills enfolded themselves majestically
in their autumn purple and deigned no answer to the
little questionings of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unsuccessful he strolled through the dining-room
and vestibule and at the hotel entrance came upon the
ramshackle hotel omnibus and the grey, raw-boned
omnibus horse standing unattended and forlorn. To
pass the time the latter shivered occasionally in order
to jingle the bells on his collar and scatter the magenta
fly-whisk hung between his eyes. Martin went up and
patted his soft muzzle and put to him the riddle. But
the old horse, who naturally thought that these overtures
heralded a supply of bodily sustenance, and, in
good faith, had essayed an expectant nibble, at last
jerked his head indignantly and refused to concern
himself with such insane speculation. Martin
was struck by the indifferent attitude of hills and
horses towards the queer vagaries of the human female.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then from the doorway sallied forth a flushed
Corinna booted and spurred for adventure. I need not
tell you that a woman’s boots and spurs are on her
head and not on her feet. Corinna wore the little hat
with the defiant pheasant feather which she had not
put on since her last night in Paris. A spot of red
burned angrily on each cheek. Martin accustomed to
ask: “Where are you going?” was on the point of
putting the mechanical question when he was checked
by one of her hard glances. Obviously she would have
nothing to do with him. She passed him by and
walked down the hill at a brisk pace. Martin watched
her retreating figure until a turn in the road hid it from
his view and then retiring into the house, went up to
his room and buried himself in Montaigne, to which
genial author, it may be remembered, he had been
recommended by Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did not meet till dinner, when she greeted him,
all smiles. She apologised for wayward temper and
graciously offered, should she need money, to accept a
small loan for a short period. What her errand had
been when she set forth in her defiant hat she did not
inform him. He shrewdly surmised she had gone to
the <span class='it'>Postes et Télégraphes</span> in the town; but he was within
a million miles of guessing that she had despatched
a telegram to Bordeaux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meal begun under these fair auspices was enlivened
by a final act of depravity on the part of the
deboshed waiter, Polydore. He had of late given more
than usual dissatisfaction, to the point of being replaced
by the chambermaid and Félise when fashionable
motordom halted at the Hôtel des Grottes. Once
Martin himself, beholding through the <span class='it'>terrasse</span> doorway
Félise struggling around a large party of belated
and hungry Americans, came to her assistance
and lent an amused hand. The guests taking him for
a deputy landlord, explained their needs in bad French.
Félise thanked him in blushing confusion, while Bigourdin,
as he had done a hundred times before, gave
a week’s notice to Polydore, who, acting scullion, was
breaking plates and dishes with drunken persistency.
And now the truth is out as regards Polydore. With
the sins of sloth, ignorance, and uncleanliness he
combined the sin of drunkenness. Polydore was nearly
always fuddled. Yet because of the ties of blood, the
foster-sisterdom of respective grandmothers, Bigourdin
had submitted to his inefficiency. Once more he
revoked the edict of dismissal. Once more Polydore
kept sober for a few days. Then once more he backslided.
And he backslided irretrievably this night at
dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All went fairly well at first. It was a slack night.
Only three <span class='it'>commis-voyageurs</span> sat at the long table, and
thus there were only seven persons on whom to attend.
It is true that his eye was somewhat glazed and
his hand somewhat unsteady; but under the awful
searchlight of Bigourdin’s glance, he nerved himself
to his task. Soup and fish had been served satisfactorily;
then came a long, long wait. Presently Polydore
reeled in. As he passed by Bigourdin’s table he
held up the finger of a dirty hand bound with a dripping
bloody rag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Pardon, je me suis coupé le doigt</span>,” he announced
thickly and made a bee-line to Corinna, with the ostensible
purpose of removing her plate. But just as he
reached her, the extra dram that he must have taken
to fortify himself against the shock of his wound, took
full effect. He staggered, and in order to save himself
clutched wildly at Corinna, leaving on her bare
neck his disgusting sanguine imprint. She uttered a
sharp cry and simultaneously Bigourdin uttered a
roar and, rushing across the room, in a second had
picked up the unhappy varlet in his giant arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ah, cochon!</span>”—he called him the most dreadful
names, shaking him as Alice shook the Red Queen.
“<span class='it'>En voilà la fin!</span> I will teach you to dare to spread
your infamous blood. I will break your bones. I
will crush your skull, so that you’ll never set foot
here again. <span class='it'>Ah! triple cochon!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flaming picture of gigantic wrath, he swept with
him to the door, whence he hurled him bodily forth.
There was a dull thud. And that, as far as the three
commercial travellers (standing agape with their napkins
at their throats), Corinna, Martin, Félise and
Bigourdin were concerned, was the end of Polydore.
Bigourdin, with an agility surprising in so huge a
man, was in an instant by Corinna’s side with finger
bowl full of water and a clean napkin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle, that such a bestial personage should
have dared to soil your purity with his uncleanness
makes me mad, makes me capable of assassinating
him. Permit me to remove his abominable contamination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me do it, <span class='it'>mon oncle</span>,” said Félise, who had run
across.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bigourdin waved her aside, and with reverent
touch, as though she were a goddess, he cleansed Corinna.
She underwent the operation in her cool way
and when it was over smiled her thanks at Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle Corinna,” he cried, “what can I
say to you? What can I do for you? How can I
repair such an outrage as you have suffered in my
house? You only have to command and everything
I have is yours. Command—insist—ordain.” He
spread his arms wide, an agony of appeal in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, who had started to his feet, in order to save
Corinna from the grip of the intoxicated Polydore,
but had been anticipated by the impetuous rush of
Bigourdin, gazed for a moment or two at his host and
then gasped, as his vision pierced into the huge man’s
soul. This perfervid declaration was not the good
innkeeper’s apology for a waiter’s disgusting behaviour.
It was the blazing indignation of a real man at
the desecration inflicted by another on the body of
the woman he loved. A shiver of comprehension of
things he had never comprehended before swept
through Martin from head to foot. He knew with
absolute knowledge that should she rise and, with a
nod of her head, invite Bigourdin to follow her to
the verandah, she could be mistress absolute of Bigourdin’s
destiny. He held his breath, for the first
time in his dull life conscious of the meaning of love
of women, conscious of eternal drama. He looked at
Corinna smiling with ironic curl of lip up at the impassioned
man. And he had an almost physical feeling
within him as though his heart sank like a stone.
But a week ago she had declared, with a vulgarity of
which he had not thought her capable, that she had
had the flirtation of her life with Bigourdin. She
must have known then, she must know now that the
man was in soul-strung earnest. What was her attitude
to the major things of Life? His brain worked
swiftly. If, in her middle-class English snobbery, she
despised the French innkeeper, why did she admit him
to her social plane on which alone flirtation—he had
a sensitive gentleman’s horror of the word—was possible?
If she accepted him as a social equal, recognising
in him, as he, Martin, recognised, all that was
vital in modern France—if she accepted him, woman
accepting man, why that infernal smile on her pretty
face? I must give you to understand that Martin
knew nothing whatever about women. His ignorance
placed him in this dilemma. He watched Corinna’s
lips eager to hear what words would issue from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said coolly: “So long as this really is the end
of Polydore, honour is satisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin stiffened under her gaze, and collecting
himself, bowed formally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to that, Mademoiselle,” said he, “I give you my
absolute assurance.” He turned to the commercial
travellers. “Messieurs, I ask your pardon. You will
not have to wait any longer. <span class='it'>Viens, Félise.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And landlord and niece took Polydore’s place for
the rest of the meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bigourdin’s a splendid fellow,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elbow on table she held a morsel of bread to her
lips. “He waits so well, doesn’t he?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shrugged his shoulders. What was the use of
arguing with a being with totally different standards
and conception of values? Some little wisdom he was
beginning to acquire. He spent the evening at the
Café de Périgueux with Bigourdin, who, with an unwonted
cloud on his brow, abused the Government in
<span class='it'>atrabiliar</span> terms.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Corinna, attired in her daintiest,
wandered off to sketch lonely and demure. At <span class='it'>déjeuner</span>
she made a pretence of eating and entertained Martin
with uninteresting and (to him) unintelligible criticism
of Parisian actors. Bigourdin passed a moment
or two of professional commonplace at the table and
retired. An inexperienced young woman of the town,
with the chambermaid’s assistance, replaced the villain
of last night’s tragedy. Corinna continued her hectic
conversation and took little account of Martin’s casual
remarks. A mind even less subtle than her companion’s
would have assigned some nervous disturbance
as a reason for such feverish behaviour. But of what
nature the disturbance? Vaguely he associated it with
the Sundayfied raiment. Could it be that she intended,
without drum or trumpet, to fly from Brantôme?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, Martin,” she said suddenly, when the
last wizened grape had been eaten, “have you ever
taken those snapshots of the Château at Bourdeilles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I haven’t,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You promised to get them for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go over with my camera one of these days,”
said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That means <span class='it'>aux Kalendes Grecques</span>. Why not this
beautiful afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll come with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve rather a headache—or I would,” said Corinna.
“As it is, I think I’ll have to lie down. But you
go. It would do you good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha!” thought Martin astutely, “she wants to get
rid of me, so that she can escape by the afternoon train
to Paris.” Aloud he said, “I’ll go to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t feel like it,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not for the first time she struck an obstinate seam
in Martin. He turned a deaf ear both to her cajolings
and her reproaches. To some degree he felt himself
responsible for Corinna, as a man must do who acts
as escort or what you will to an attractive and penniless
young woman. If she had decided to rush home to
England, it was certainly his duty to make commodious
arrangements for her journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to loaf about to-day,” he announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like the selfish pig you always are,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Comme tu veux</span>,” said Martin cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see I want you to go away for the afternoon?”
said Corinna angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any idiot could see that,” replied Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to keep an eye on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flushed scarlet and rose from the table. “All
right. Spy as much as you like. It doesn’t matter
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more she left him with a dramatic whirl of
skirts. The procedure having become monotonous impressed
Martin less than on previous occasions. He
even smiled at the conscious smile of sagacity. There
was something up, he reflected, with Corinna, or he
would eat his hat. She contemplated some idiotic
action. Of that there could be no doubt. It behoved
him, as the only protector she had in the world, to
mount guard. He mounted guard, therefore, over
cigarette and coffee in the vestibule of the hotel, and
for some time held entertaining converse with Bigourdin
on the decadence of Germanic culture, and while
Martin was expounding the futile vulgarity of the
spectacle of Sumurum which, on one of his rare visits
to places of amusement, he had witnessed in London,
the word of Corinna’s enigma was suddenly and dustily
flashed upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a dusty two-seater car that drew up noisily
at the door, sprang a dusty youth with a reddish face
and a little black moustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Mademoiselle Hastings in the hotel?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, monsieur,” said Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you kindly let her know that I am here—Monsieur
Camille Fargot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Fargot,” repeated Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle Hastings expects me,” said the
young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bien, monsieur</span>,” said Bigourdin. He retired, his
duty as a good innkeeper compelling him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, comfortable in his cane chair, lit another
cigarette and with dispassionate criticism inspected
Monsieur Camille Fargot, who stood in the doorway,
his back to the vestibule, frowning resentfully on the
little car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This then was the word of Corinna’s enigma. To
summon him by telegraph had been the object of her
sortie in the hat with the pheasant’s plume. To welcome
him had been the reason of her festive garb.
In order to hold unembarrassed converse she had
tried to send Martin away to photograph Bourdeilles.
This then was the famous student in medicine who was
supposed to have won Corinna’s heart. Martin who
had of late added mightily to his collection of remarkable
men thought him as commonplace a young student
as he had encountered since the far off days of Margett’s
Universal College. He seemed an indeterminate,
fretful person, the kind of male over whom Corinna
in her domineering way would gallop and re-gallop
until she had trampled the breath out of him. Being
a kindly soul, he began to feel sorry for Camille
Fargot. He was tempted to go up to the young fellow,
lay a hand on his shoulder and say: “If you want to
lead a happy married life, my dear chap, drive straight
back to Bordeaux and marry somebody else.” By doing
so, he would indubitably contribute to the greatest
happiness of the greatest number of human beings and
would rank among the philanthropists of his generation.
But Martin still retained much of his timidity
and he also had a comradely feeling towards Corinna.
If she regarded this dusty and undistinguished young
gentleman as the rock of her salvation, who was he,
powerless himself to indicate any other rock of any
kind, to offer objection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>So realising the absurdity of standing on guard
against so insignificant a danger as Monsieur Camille
Fargot, student in medicine, and not desiring to disconcert
Corinna by his presence should she descend to
the vestibule to meet her lover, he courteously begged
pardon of the frowning young man who blocked the
doorway, and, passing by him, walked meditatively
down the road.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span><span class='sc'>HEN</span> Martin returned to the hotel a couple
of hours later, he found that Monsieur Camille
Fargot had departed, and that Corinna
had entrenched herself in her room. On the wane of
the afternoon she sent word to any whom it might concern
that, not being hungry, she would not come down
for dinner. To Félise, anxious concerning her health,
she denied access. Offers of comforting nourishment
on a tray made on the outer side of the closed door
she curtly declined. Mystery enveloped the visit of
Camille Fargot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin learned from a perturbed Bigourdin that
she had descended immediately after he had left the
vestibule and had led Fargot at once into the <span class='it'>Salon de
Lecture</span>, a moth-eaten and fusty cubby-hole in which
commercial travellers who found morbid pleasure in
the early stages of asphyxiation sometimes wrote their
letters. There they had remained for some time, at
the end of which Monsieur Fargot—“<span class='it'>il avait l’air
hébété</span>,” according to Baptiste, a witness of his exit—had
issued forth alone and jumped into his car and
sped away, presumably to Bordeaux. After a moment
or two Mademoiselle Corinne, in her turn, had emerged
from the <span class='it'>Salon de Lecture</span> and looking very haughty
with her pretty head in the air—(again Baptiste)—had
mounted to her apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those were the bare facts. Bigourdin narrated them
simply, in order to account for Corinna’s non-appearance
at dinner. With admirable taste he forbore to
question Martin as to the relations between the lady
and her visitor. Nor did Martin enlighten him. An
art-student in Paris like Corinna must necessarily have
a host of friends. What more natural than that one,
finding himself in her neighbourhood, should make a
passing call. Such was the tacit convention between
Martin and Bigourdin. But the breast of each harboured
the conviction that the visit had not been a
success of cordiality. Bigourdin exhibited brighter
spirits that night at the Café de l’Univers. He played
his game of backgammon with Monsieur le Maire and
beat him exultantly. Around him the coterie cursed
the Germans for forcing the three years’ service on
France. He paused, arm uplifted in the act of throwing
the dice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind. They seek it—they will get it. <span class='it'>Vous
l’avez voulu, Georges Dandin.</span> The <span class='it'>bon Dieu</span> is on
our side, just as He is on mine in this battle here.
<span class='it'>Vlan!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dice rattled out of the box and they showed
the number that declared him the winner. A great
shout arose. The honest burgesses cried miracle.
<span class='it'>Voyons</span>, it was a sign from heaven to France. “<span class='it'>In
hoc signo vinces!</span>” cried a professor at the <span class='it'>Ecole Normale</span>,
and the sober company had another round of
bocks to celebrate the augury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin and Bigourdin walked home through the
narrow, silent streets and over the bridges. There was
a high wind sharpened by a breath of autumn which
ruffled the dim surface of the water; and overhead a
rack of cloud scudded athwart the stars. A light or
two far up the gloomy scaur shewed the Hôtel
des Grottes. Bigourdin waved his hand in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is beautiful, all this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin assented and buttoned up his overcoat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is beautiful to me,” said Bigourdin, “because it
is my own country. I was born and bred here and my
forefathers before me. It is part of me like my legs
and my arms. I don’t say that I am beautiful myself,”
he added, with a laugh, his French wit seeing whither
logic would lead him. “But you understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Martin. “I can understand in a way.
But I have no little corner of a country that I can call
my own. I’m not the son of any soil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Périgord is very fruitful and motherly. She will
adopt you,” laughed Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am English of the English,” replied Martin.
“Périgord would only adopt a Frenchman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard it said and I believe it to be true,”
said Bigourdin, “that every English artist has two
countries, his own and France. And it is the artist
who expresses the national feeling and not the university
professors and philosophers; and all true men
have in them something of the artistic, something
which responds to the artistic appeal—I don’t know
if I make myself clear, Monsieur Martin—but you
must confess that all the outside inspiration you get
in England in your art and your literature is Latin.
I say ‘outside,’ for naturally you draw from your own
noble wells; but for nearly a generation the <span class='it'>fin esprit
anglais</span>, in all its delicacy and all its subtlety and all
its humanity is in every way sympathetic with the <span class='it'>fin
esprit français</span>. Is not that true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I come to think of it,” said Martin, “I suppose
it is. I represent the more or less educated middle-class
Englishman, and, so far as I am aware of any
influence on my life, everything outside of England
that has moved me has been French. As far as I know,
Germany has not produced one great work of art or
literature during the last forty years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Voilà!</span>” cried Bigourdin, “how could a pig of a
country like that produce works of art? I haven’t
been to Berlin. But I have seen photographs of the
Allée des Victoires. <span class='it'>Mon cher</span>, it is terrible. It is
sculpture hewn out by orders of the drill sergeant’s
cane. <span class='it'>Ah, cochon de pays!</span> But you others, you English—at
last, after our hundred years of peace, you
realise how bound you are to France. You realise—all
the noble souls among you—that your language is half
Latin, that for a thousand years, even before the Norman
conquest, all your culture, all the sympathies of
your poetry and your art are Roman—and Greek—<span class='it'>enfin</span>
are Latin. Your wonderful cathedrals—Gothic—do
you get them from Teutonic barbarism? No.
You get them from the Comacine masters—the little
band of Latin spiritualists on the shores of Lake
Como. I am an ignorant man, Monsieur Martin, but I
have read a little and I have much time to think and—<span class='it'>voilà</span>—those
are my conclusions. In the great war
that will come——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t come in our time,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? It will come in our time. And sooner than
you expect. But when it does come, all that is noble
and spiritual in England will be passionately French
in its sympathies. <span class='it'>Tiens, mon ami</span>—” he planted himself
at the corner of the dark uphill road that led
to the hotel, and brought his great hands down on
Martin’s shoulders. “You do not yet understand.
You are a wonderful race, you English. But if you
were pure Frisians, like the German, you would not be
where you are. Nor would you be if you were pure
Latins. What has made you invincible is the interfusion
since a thousand years of all that is best in
Frisian and Latin. You emerged English after Chaucer—Saxon
bone and Latin spirit. That is why, my
friend, you hate all that is German. That is why you
love now all that is French. And that is why we, <span class='it'>nous
autres Français</span>, feel at last that England understands
us and is with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having thus analysed the psychology of the Entente
Cordiale in terms which proceeding from the lips of a
small English innkeeper would have astounded Martin,
Bigourdin released him and together they mounted
homewards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was forgetting,” said he, as he bade Martin good-night.
“All of what I said was to prove that if you
were in need of a foster-mother, Périgord will take
you to her bosom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll think of it,” smiled Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought of it for five minutes after he had gone
to bed and then fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in the morning he was awakened by a great
thundering at his door. Convinced of catastrophe,
he leaped to his feet and opened. On the threshold the
urbane figure of Fortinbras confronted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You?” cried Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even I. Having embraced Félise, breakfasted,
washed and viewed Brantôme proceeding to its daily
labours, I thought it high time to arouse you from your
unlarklike slumbers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saying this he passed Martin and drew aside the
curtains so that the morning light flooded the room.
He was still attired in his sober black with the <span class='it'>avoué’s</span>
white tie which bore the traces of an all-night journey.
Then he sat down on the bed, while Martin, in
pyjamas and bare-foot, took up an irresolute position
on the cold boards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I generally get up a bit later,” said Martin with an
air of apology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I gather from my excellent brother-in-law.
Well,” said Fortinbras, “how are you faring in Arcadia?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Capitally,” replied Martin. “I’ve never felt so
fit in my life. But I’m jolly glad you’ve come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want another consultation? I am ready to give
you one. The usual fee, of course. Oh, not now!”
As Martin turned to the dressing table where lay a
small heap of money, he raised a soft, arresting hand.
“The hour is too early for business even in France.
I have no doubt Corinna is equally anxious to consult
me. How is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much the same as usual,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By which you would imply that she belongs to
the present stubborn and stiff-necked generation of
young Englishwomen. I hope you haven’t suffered
unduly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? Oh, Lord, no!” Martin replied, with a laugh.
“Corinna goes her way and I go mine. Occasionally
when there’s only one way to go—well, it isn’t hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve put your foot down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate Corinna hasn’t put her foot down on
me. I think,” said Martin, rubbing his thinly clad
sides meditatively, “my journey with Corinna has not
been without profit to myself. I’ve made a discovery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear young friend,” said Fortinbras, “let me
hear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve found out that I needn’t be trampled on unless
I like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras passed his hand over his broad forehead
and his silver mane and regarded the young man
acutely. Whatever possibilities he might have seen
of a romantic attachment between the pair of derelicts
no longer existed. Martin had taken cool measure of
Corinna and was not the least in love with her. The
Dealer in Happiness smiled in his benevolent way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Although in your present ruffled and unshorn state
you’re not looking your best, you’re a different man
from my client of two months ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks to your advice,” said Martin, “my three
weeks’ journey put me into gorgeous health and here
I’ve been living in clover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the environment does not seem to be unfavourable
to moral and intellectual development.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Bigourdin and his friends,” cried Martin.
“He is a splendid fellow, a liberal education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s an apostle of sanity,” replied Fortinbras with
an approving nod. “Meanwhile sanity would not recommend
your standing about in this chilly air with
nothing on. I will converse with you while you dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have my tub at once,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He disappeared into the famous bathroom and
after a few moments returned and made his toilet
while he gossiped with Fortinbras of the things he
had learned at the Café de l’Univers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a funny thing,” said he, “but I can’t make
Corinna see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s Parisianised,” replied Fortinbras. “In Paris
we see things in false perspective. All the little finnicky
people of the hour, artists, writers, politicians
are so close to us that they loom up like mountains.
You learn more of France in a week at Brantôme
than in a year at Paris, because here there’s nothing
to confuse your sense of values. Happy young man
to live in Brantôme!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sighed and, seeing that Martin was ready, rose
and accompanied him downstairs. Félise, fresh and
dainty, with heightened colour and gladness in her eyes
due to the arrival of the adored father, poured out
Martin’s coffee. They were old-fashioned in the Hôtel
des Grottes, and drank coffee out of generous bowls
without handles, beside which, on the plate, rested
great spoons for such sops of bread as might be
thrown therein.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is as you like it?” she asked in her pretty, clipped
English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s always the best coffee I have ever drunk,”
smiled Martin. He looked up at Fortinbras lounging
in the wooden chair usually occupied by Corinna.
“Do you know, Mr. Fortinbras, that Mademoiselle
Félise has so spoilt me with food and drink that I
shall never be able to face an English lodging-house
meal again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras passed his arm round his daughter’s waist
and drew her to him affectionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She would spoil me too, if she had the chance. It
is astonishing what capability there is in this little
body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise, yielding to the caress, touched her father’s
hair. “It’s like <span class='it'>mamman</span>, when she was young, <span class='it'>n’est-ce
pas</span>?” She spoke in French which came more readily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Fortinbras, in a deep voice. “Just
like your mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I try to resemble her. <span class='it'>Tu sais</span>, every time I feel
I am lazy or missing my duties, I think of <span class='it'>mamman</span>,
and I say, ‘No, I will not be unworthy of her.’ And
so that gives me courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard so much of Mrs. Fortinbras,” said
Martin, “that I seem to know her intimately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A smile of great tenderness and sadness crept into
Fortinbras’s eyes as he turned them on his daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good that you still think and speak so much
of her. Ideals keep the soul winged for flight. If it
flies away into the empyrean and comes to grief like
Icarus and his later fellow pioneers in aviation, at
least it has done something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He released her and she sped away on her duties.
Presently she returned with a scared face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Martin, what has happened? Here is
Corinna going to leave us this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Corinna going? Does she know I’m here?” asked
Fortinbras in wonderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I haven’t seen her. I did not dream
that she was up—she generally rises so late. But she
has told Baptiste to take down her boxes for the omnibus
to catch the early train for Paris. <span class='it'>Mon Dieu</span>, what
has happened to drive her away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps the visit yesterday of Monsieur Camille
Fargot,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” said Fortinbras sharply. Then turning to
Félise. “Go, my dear, and lay my humble homage at
the feet of Mademoiselle Corinna and say that as I
have travelled for nearly a day and a night in order to
see her, I crave her courtesy so far as to defer her departure
until I can have speech with her. You can
also tell Baptiste that I’ll break his neck if he touches
those boxes. The omnibus might also anticipate its
usual hour of starting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise departed. Fortinbras lit a cigarette, and
holding it between his fingers, frowned at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Camille Fargot? What was that spawn of nothingness
doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy she sent for him,” said Martin. “I suppose
I had better tell you all about it. I haven’t as yet—because
it was none of my business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Proceed,” said Fortinbras, and Martin told him
of the famous balance-striking and of Corinna’s subsequent
behaviour, including last night’s retirement
into solitude after her mysterious interview with the
spawn of nothingness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” said Fortinbras, when Martin had finished.
“Very good. And what had my excellent brother-in-law
to say to it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your excellent brother-in-law,” replied Martin,
with a smile, “seems to be a very delicate-minded gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras did not press the subject. Waiting for
Corinna, they talked of casual things. Martin, now a
creature of health and appetite, devoured innumerable
rolls and absorbed many bowls of coffee, to the outspoken
admiration of Fortinbras. But still Corinna
did not come. Then Martin filled a pipe of caporal
and, smoking it with gusto, told Fortinbras more of
what he had learned at the Café de l’Univers. He
expressed his wonder at the people’s lack of enthusiasm
for their political leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The adventurer politician is the curse of this country,”
said Fortinbras. “He insinuates himself into
every government. He is out for plunder and his
hand is at the throat of patriotic ministers, and he
strangles France, while into his pockets through devious
channels filters a fine stream of German gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t believe it,” cried Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! He isn’t a traitor in the sense of being suborned
by a foreign Power. He is far too subtle. But
he knows what policy will affect the world’s exchanges
to his profit; and that policy he advocates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A gangrene in the body politic,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras nodded assent. “It will only be the
sword of war that will cut it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this, in marched Corinna dressed for travel, with
a little embroidered bag slung over her arm. She
crossed the room, her head up, her chin in the air,
defiant as usual, and shook hands with Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come as you asked,” she said. “But let us be
quick with the talking, as I’ve got to catch a train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” said Fortinbras, setting a chair for
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She obeyed and there the three of them were sitting
once more round a table in an empty dining room. But
this time it was a cloudy morning in early November,
in the heart of France, the distant mountains across
the town half-veiled in mist, and a fine rain falling.
Gusts of raw air came in through the open terrace window
at the end of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, my dear Corinna,” said Fortinbras, “you have
not waited for the second consultation which was part
of our programme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s your fault, not mine,” said Corinna. “I
expected you weeks ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless. But your expectation was no reason
for my coming weeks ago. My undertaking, however,
was a reason for your continuing to expect me
and being certain that sooner or later I should come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Corinna. “This is mere talk.
What do you want with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To ask you, my dear Corinna,” replied Fortinbras,
in his persuasive tones, “why you have disregarded
my advice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what was your advice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To do nothing headstrong, violent and lunatic until
we met again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have come sooner. I find I am living
now on Martin’s charity and the time has come to put
all this rubbish aside and go home to my people with
my tail between my legs. It’s vastly pleasant, I assure
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, young woman of little faith!—Why did you
not put your trust in me, instead of in callow medical
students with ridiculous mothers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna flushed crimson and her eyes hardened in
anger. “I suppose every gossiping tongue in this horrid
little hotel has been wagging. That’s why I’m going
off now, so that they can wag in my absence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my dear Penthesilea,” said Fortinbras soothingly,
“why get so angry? Every living soul in this
horrid hotel is on your side. They would give their
eyes and ears to help you and sympathise with you
and shew you that they love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want their sympathy,” said Corinna stubbornly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or any human expression of affection or regret?
You want just to pay your bill like any young woman
in an automobile who has put up for the night and go
your way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I don’t. But I’ve been damnably treated and
I want to get away back to England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who has treated you damnably here?” asked Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be idiotic,” cried Corinna. “Everybody here
has been simply angelic to me—even Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the whole I think I’ve behaved fairly decently
since we started out together,” Martin observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate you act according to the instincts of
a gentleman,” she admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras leaned back in his chair and drew a
breath of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to perceive that this hurried departure is
not an elopement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elopement!” she echoed. “Do you think I’d——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras checked her with his uplifted hand.
“Sh! Would you like me to tell you in a few words
everything that has happened?” He bent his intellectual
brow upon her and held her with his patient, tired
eyes. “Being at the end of your resources, not desiring
to share in the vagabond’s pool with Martin, and
losing faith in my professional pledge, you bethink
you of the young popinjay with whom, in your independent
English innocence, but to the scandal of his
French relatives, you have flaunted it in the restaurants
and theatres of Paris. <span class='it'>Il vous a conté fleurette.</span>
He has made his little love to you. All honour and no
blame to him. At his age”—he bowed—“I would have
done the same. You correspond on the sentimental
plane. But in all his correspondence you will find not
one declaration in form.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna mechanically peeled off her gloves. Fortinbras
drew a whiff of his cigarette. He continued:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think of him as a possible husband: I am frank—it
is my profession to be so. But your heart,”—he
pointed dramatically to her bosom—“has never had a
flutter. You don’t deny it. Good. In your extremity,
as you think, you send him an urgent telegram, such
as no man of human feeling could disregard. He borrows
his cousin’s husband’s motor-car and obeys your
summons. You interview him in yonder little fly-blown,
suffocating salon. You put your case before
him—with no matter what feminine delicacy. He perceives
that he is confronted with a claim for a demand
in marriage. He draws back. He cannot by
means of any quirk or quibble of French law marry
you without his parent’s consent. This they would
never give, having their own well-matured and irrefragable
plans. Marriage is as impossible as immediate
canonization. ‘But,’ says he, ‘we are both
young. We love each other, we shall both be in the
<span class='it'>quartier</span> for time indefinite’—time is never definite,
thank God, to youth—‘Why should we not set up
housekeeping together? I have enough for both—and
let the future take care of itself.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna rose and looked at him haggardly and
clutched him by the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, in the name of God, do you know that? Who
told you? Who overheard that little beast propose
that I should go and live with him as his mistress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras patted the white-knuckled hand and
smiled, as he looked up into her tense face. “Do you
suppose, my dear child, that I have been the father
confessor of half the <span class='it'>Rive Gauche</span> for twenty years
without knowing something of the ways of the <span class='it'>Rive
Gauche</span>? without knowing something, not exactly of
international, but say of multi-national codes of social
observance, morality, honour, and so forth, and how
they clash, correspond and interact? I know the two
international forces—yours and Camille Fargot’s,
converging on the matrimonial point—and with simple
certainty I tell you the resultant. It’s like a schoolboy’s
exercise in mathematics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She freed herself and sat down again dejectedly.
Everything had happened as Fortinbras declared. His
only omission, to repair which she had not given him
time, was the scene of flaming indignation incident to
Camille Fargot’s dismissal. And his psychology was
correct. The young man’s charming love-making had
flattered her, had indeed awakened foolish hopes; but
she had never cared a button for him. Now she loathed
him with a devastating hate. She thrummed with her
fingers on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is there left for me to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, now,” said Fortinbras genially, “we’re talking
sense. Now we come to our famous second professional
consultation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead then,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mentioned the word ‘professional,’ ” Fortinbras
remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin laughed and put a ten-franc piece into the
soft open palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll pay for both,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like having your fortune told at a fair,” said
Corinna. “But hurry up!” she glanced at her watch.
“As it is, I shan’t have time to pay my bill. Will you
see after it?” she drew from her bag one of the borrowed
notes and threw it across to Martin. “Well, I
am all attention. I can give you three minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just then a familiar sound of scrunching wheels
came through the open doors of the vestibule and
dining-room. She started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the omnibus going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The omnibus gone,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll miss my train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My luggage has gone with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has not,” said Fortinbras. “I gave instructions
that it should not be brought down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna gasped. “Of all the cool impertinence——!”
She looked at her watch again. “And
the beastly thing has started long before its time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At my request,” said Fortinbras. “And now, as
there is no possibility of your getting away from
Brantôme for several hours, perhaps you might, with
profit, abandon your attitude of indignation and listen
to the voice of reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way,” said Martin, “have you had your
<span class='it'>petit déjeuner</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Corinna sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” cried Fortinbras, holding up his
hands, “and they let women run about loose!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>C</span><span class='sc'>ORINNA</span> fortified by urgently summoned nourishment
lit a cigarette and sarcastically announced
her readiness to listen to the oracle.
The oracle bowed with his customary benevolence and
spoke for a considerable time in florid though unambiguous
terms. To say that Corinna was surprised by
the proposal which he set before her would inadequately
express her indignant stupefaction. She sat
angry, with reddened cheek-bones and tightly screwed
lips, perfectly silent, letting the wretched man complete
his amazing pronouncement before she should
annihilate him. He was still pronouncing, however,
when Bigourdin appeared at the door. Fortinbras
broke off in the middle of a sentence and called him
into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My good Gaspard,” said he, in French, for Bigourdin
knew little English, “I am suggesting to mademoiselle
a scheme for her perfect happiness of which
I have reason to know you will approve. Sit down and
join our conclave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I approve of everything in advance,” said the huge
man, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I suppose you’re aware of this delicious
scheme?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said he; “but I have boundless confidence
in my brother-in-law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His idea is that I should enter your employment
as a kind of forewoman in your <span class='it'>fabrique</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that is famous!” exclaimed Bigourdin, with a
sparkle in his eyes. “It could only enter into that wise
head yonder. The trade is getting beyond Félise and
myself. Sooner or later I must get some one, a woman,
to take charge of the manufacturing department.
I have told Daniel my difficulties and he comes now
with this magnificent solution. <span class='it'>Car c’est vraiment
magnifique.</span>” He beamed all over his honest face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would have to learn the business from the
beginning,” said Fortinbras quickly. “That would be
easy, as you would have willing instructors, and as
you are not deficient in ordinary intelligence. You
would rise every day in self-esteem and dignity and
at last find yourself of use in the social organism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You propose then,” said Corinna, restraining the
annihilatory outburst owing to Bigourdin’s presence
and shaking with suppressed wrath, “you propose then
that I should spend the life that God has given me in
making <span class='it'>pâté de foie gras</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better that than spend it in making bad pictures or
a fool of yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve given up painting,” Corinna replied, “and every
woman makes a fool of herself. Hence the perpetuation
of the human species.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In your case, my dear Corinna,” said Fortinbras,
“that would be commendable folly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are insulting,” she cried, her cheeks aflame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tiens, tiens!</span>” said Bigourdin, laying his great hand
on his brother-in-law’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Fortinbras stroked back his white mane and
regarded them both with leonine serenity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To meet a cynical gibe with a retort implying that
marriage and motherhood are woman’s commendable
lot cannot be regarded as an insult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna scoffed: “How do you manage to do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talk like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By means of an education not entirely rudimentary,”
replied Fortinbras in his blandest tone. “In the
meanwhile you haven’t replied to my suggestion.
Once you said you would like to take life by the throat
and choke something big out of it. You still want to
do it—but you can’t. You know you can’t, my dear
Corinna. Even the people that can perform this garrotting
feat squeeze precious little happiness out of it.
Happiness comes to mortals through the most subtle
channels. I suggest it might come to you through the
liver of an overfed goose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Corinna’s outburst, Bigourdin’s sunny face had
clouded over. “Mademoiselle Corinna,” said he earnestly,
“if you would deign to accept such a position,
which after all has in it nothing dishonourable, I assure
you from my heart that you would be treated with all
esteem and loyalty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s perfect courtesy disarmed her. Of course
she was still indignant with Fortinbras. That she,
Corinna Hastings, last type of emancipated English
womanhood, bent on the expression of a highly important
self, should calmly be counselled to bury herself
in a stuffy little French town and become a sort
of housekeeper in a shabby little French hotel. The
suggestion was preposterous, an outrage to the highly-important
self, reckoning it a thing of no account.
Why not turn her into a chambermaid or a goose-herd
at once? The contemptuous assumption fired her
wrath. She was furious with Fortinbras. But Bigourdin,
who treated the subject from the point of view of
one who asked a favour, deserved a civil answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Bigourdin,” she said with a becoming
air of dignity tempered by a pitying smile, “I know
that you are everything that is kind, and I thank you
most sincerely for your offer, but for private reasons
it is one that I cannot accept. You must forgive me
if I return to England, where my duty calls me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your duty—to whom?” asked Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She petrified him with a glance. “To myself,” she
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case there’s nothing more to be said,” remarked
Bigourdin dismally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s everything to be said,” declared Fortinbras.
“But it’s not worth while saying it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna rose and gathered up her gloves. “I’m glad
you realise the fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin rose too and detained her for a second.
“If you would do me the honour of accepting our hospitality
for just a day or two”—delicately he included
Félise as hostess—“perhaps you might be induced to
reconsider your decision.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was not be moved—even by Martin who,
having smoked the pipe of discreet silence during the
discussion, begged her to postpone her departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow, wait,” said he, “until our good counsellor
tells us what he proposes to do for me. As we started
in together, it’s only fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Corinna. “Let us hear. What <span class='it'>ordonnance
de bonheur</span> have you for Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you very anxious to know?” asked Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally,” said Martin, and he added hastily in
English, being somewhat shy of revealing himself to
Bigourdin: “Corinna can tell you that I’ve been loyal
to you all through. I’ve had a sort of blind confidence
in you. I’ve chucked everything. But I’m nearly at
the end of the financial tether, and something must
happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sans doute</span>,” said Fortinbras. So as to bring Bigourdin
into range again, he continued in French.
“To tell you what is going to happen is one of the
reasons why I am here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, tell us,” said Corinna, “I can’t stand here
all day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you sit down, mademoiselle?” said Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna took her vacated chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you ever going to begin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had prepared,” replied Fortinbras benevolently,
“an exhaustive analysis of our young friend’s financial,
moral and spiritual state of being. But, as you
appear to be impatient, I will forego the pleasure of
imparting to you this salutary instruction. So perhaps
it is better that I should come to the point at
once. He is practically penniless. He has abandoned
all ideas of returning to his soul-stifling profession.
But he must, in the commonplace way of mortals, earn
his living. His soul has had a complete rest for three
months. It is time now that it should be stimulated
to effort that shall result in consequences more glorious
than the poor human phenomenon that is, I can predict.
My prescription of happiness, as you, Corinna,
have so admirably put it, is that Martin shall take the
place of the unclean Polydore, who, I understand, has
recently been ejected with ignominy from this establishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His small audience gasped in three separate and particular
fashions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon vieux, c’est idiot!</span>” cried Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a career,” cried Corinna, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never thought of that,” said Martin, thumping
the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras rubbed his soft hands together. “I don’t
deal in the obvious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon vieux</span>, you are laughing at us,” said Bigourdin.
“Monsieur Martin, a gentleman, a scholar, a
professor——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A speck of human dust in search of a soul,” said
Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which he’s going to find among dirty plates and
dishes,” scoffed Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the eyes of the Distributing Department of the
Soul Office of Olympus, where every little clerk is a
Deuce of a High God, the clatter of plates and dishes
is as important as the clash of armies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna looked at Bigourdin. “He’s raving mad,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras rose unruffled and laid a hand on Martin’s
shoulder. “My excellent friend and disciple,”
said he, “let us leave the company of these obscurantists,
and seek enlightenment in the fresh air of heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon he led the young man to the terrace
and walked up and down discoursing with philosophical
plausibility while his white hair caught by the gusty
breeze streamed behind like a shaggy meteor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin, who had remained standing, sat down
again and said apologetically:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brother-in-law is an oddity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you,” assented Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a short silence. Corinna felt that the time
had come for a dignified retirement. But whither repair
at this unconscionably early hour? The hotel
resembled now a railway station at which she was
doomed to wait interminably, and one spot seemed as
good as another. So she did not move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have decided then to leave us, Mademoiselle
Corinna?” said Bigourdin at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there no means by which I could persuade you
to stay? I desire enormously that you should
stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her glance met his and lowered. The tone of his
voice thrilled her absurdly. She had at once an impulse
to laugh and a queer triumphant little flutter of
the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To make <span class='it'>pâté de foie gras</span>? You must have unwarrantable
faith in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, in the end,” said he soberly, “it might
amuse you to make <span class='it'>pâté de foie gras</span>. Who knows?
All things are possible.” He paused for a moment,
then bent forward, elbow on table and chin in hand.
“This is but a little hotel in a little town, but in it one
might find tranquillity and happiness—<span class='it'>enfin</span>, the significance
of things,—of human things. For I believe
that where human beings live and love and suffer and
strive, there is an eternal significance beneath the
commonplace, and if we grasp it, it leads us to the
root of life, which is happiness. Don’t you think so,
mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’re right,” she admitted dubiously,
never having taken the trouble to look at existence
from the subjective standpoint. Her attitude was instinctively
objective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, mademoiselle,” said he. “I said that
because I want to put something before you. And it
is not very easy. I repeat—this is but a little hotel in
a little town. I too am but a man of the people,
Mademoiselle; but this hotel—my father added to it
and transformed it, but it is the same property—this
hotel has been handed down from father to son for a
hundred years. My great-grandfather, a simple peasant,
rose to be <span class='it'>Général de Brigade</span> in the <span class='it'>Grand Armée</span>
of Napoléon. After Waterloo, he would accept no
favour from the Bourbons, and retired to Brantôme,
the home of his race, and with his little economies he
bought the Hôtel des Grottes, at which he had worked
years before as a little <span class='it'>va-nu-pieds</span>, turnspit, holder of
horses—<span class='it'>que sais-je, moi</span>? Those were days, mademoiselle,
of many revolutions of fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all that means——?” asked Corinna, impressed,
in spite of English prejudice, by the simple
yet not inglorious ancestry of the huge innkeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means, mademoiselle,” said Bigourdin, “that I
wish to present myself to you as an honest man. But
as I am of no credit, myself, I would like to expose
to you the honour of my family. My great-grandfather,
as I have said, was <span class='it'>Général de Brigade</span> in the
<span class='it'>Grande Armée</span>. My grandfather, <span class='it'>simple soldat</span>,
fought side by side with the English in the Crimea. My
father, Sergeant of Artillery, lost a leg and an arm in
the War of 1870. My younger brother was killed in
Morocco. For me, I have done my <span class='it'>service militaire</span>.
<span class='it'>Ou fait ce qu’on peut.</span> It is chance that I am forty
years of age and live in obscurity. But my name is
known and respected in all Périgord, mademoiselle——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And again—all that means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That if a <span class='it'>petit hôtelier</span> like me ventures to lay a
proposition at the feet of a <span class='it'>jeune fille de famille</span> like
yourself—the <span class='it'>petit hôtelier</span> wishes to assure her of the
perfect <span class='it'>honorabilité</span> of his family. In short, Mademoiselle
Corinne, I love you very sincerely. I can
make no phrases, for when I say I love you, it comes
from the innermost depths of my being. I am a simple
man,” he continued very earnestly, and with an
air of hope, as Corinna flashed out no repulse, but sat
sphinx-like, looking away from him across the room,
“a very simple man; but my heart is loyal. Such as I
am, Mademoiselle Corinne—and you have had an opportunity
of judging—I have the honour to ask you if
you will be my wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinne knew enough of France to realise that all
this was amazing. The average Frenchman, whom
Bigourdin represented, is passionate but not romantic.
If he sets his heart on a woman, be she the angel-eyed
spouse of another respectable citizen or the tawdry and
naughty little figurante in a provincial company, he
does his honest (or dishonest) best to get her. <span class='it'>C’est
l’amour</span>, and there’s an end to it. But he envisages
marriage from a totally different angle. Far be it from
me to say that he does not entertain very sincere and
tender sentiments towards the young lady he proposes
to marry. But he only proposes to marry a young lady
who can put a certain capital into the business partnership
which is an essential feature of marriage. If
he is attracted towards a damsel of pleasing ways but
devoid of capital, he either behaves like the appalling
Monsieur Camille Fargot, or puts his common sense,
like a non-conducting material, between them, and in
all simplicity, doesn’t fall in love with her. But here
was a manifestation of freakishness. Here was Bigourdin,
man of substance, who could have gone to
any one of twenty families of substance in Périgord
and chosen from it an impeccable and well-dowered
bride—here he was snapping his fingers at French
bourgeois tradition—than which there is nothing more
sacrosanct—putting his common sense into his cap and
throwing it over the windmills, and acting in a manner
which King Cophetua himself, had he been a Frenchman,
would have condemned as either unconventional
or insane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna’s English upper middle-class pride had revolted
at the suggestion that she should become an employee
in a little bourgeois inn; but her knowledge of
French provincial life painfully quickened by her experience
of yesterday assured her that she was the recipient
of the greatest honour that lies in the power of
a French citizen to offer. An English innkeeper daring
to propose marriage she would have scorched with
blazing indignation, and the bewildered wretch would
have gone away wondering how he had mistaken for
an angel such a Catherine-wheel of a woman. But
against Bigourdin, son of other traditions so secure in
his integrity, so delicate in his approach, so intensely
sincere in his appeal, she could find within her not
a spark of anger. All conditions were different. The
plane of their relations was different. She would never
have confessed to a flirtation with an English innkeeper.
Besides, she had a really friendly feeling for
Bigourdin, something of admiration. He was so big,
so simple, so genuine, so intelligent. In spite of Martin’s
complaint that she could not realise the spirit of
modern France, her shrewd observation had missed
little of the moral and spiritual phenomena of Brantôme.
She was well aware that Bigourdin, <span class='it'>petit hôtelier</span>
that he was, stood for many noble ideals outside
her own narrow horizon. She respected him; she also
derived feminine pleasure from his small mouth and
the colour of his eyes. But the possibility of marrying
him had never entered her head. She had not the remotest
intention of marrying him now. The proposal
was grotesque. As soon as she got clear of the place
she would throw back her head and roar with laughter
at it; a gleeful little devil was already dancing at the
back of her brain. For the moment, however, she did
not laugh: on the contrary a queer thrill again ran
through her body, and she felt a difficulty in looking
him in the face. After having thrown herself at a
man’s head yesterday only to be spurned, her outraged
spirit found solace in having to-day another man suppliant
at her feet. Of his sincerity there could be no
possible question. This big, good man loved her. For
all her independent ways and rackety student experiences,
no man before had come to her with the loyalty
of deep love in his eyes, no man had asked her to be
his wife. Absurd as it all was, she felt its flattering
deliciousness in every fibre of her being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Eh bien</span>, Mademoiselle Corinne, what do you answer?”
asked Bigourdin, after a breathless silence during
which, with head bent forward over the table, she
had been nervously fiddling with her gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very kind, Monsieur Bigourdin. I never
thought you felt like that towards me,” she said falteringly,
like any well-brought-up school-girl. “You
should have told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To have expressed my feelings before, Mademoiselle,
would have been to take advantage of your position
under my roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly there came an unprecedented welling of
tears in her eyes, and a lump in her throat. She sprang
to her feet and with rare impulsiveness thrust out her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Bigourdin, you are the best man I have
ever met. I am your friend, your very great friend.
But I can’t marry you. It is impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose too, holding her and put the eternal question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You deserve a wife who loves you. I don’t love
you. I never could love you”—and then from the infinite
spaces of loneliness there spread about her soul
a frozen desolation, and she stood as one blasted by
Polar wind—“I shall never love a man all my life
long. I am not made like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she seemed to shrivel in his grasp and, flitting
between the snow-clad tables like a wraith, was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bigre!</span>” said Bigourdin, sitting down again.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Soon afterwards, Fortinbras and Martin, coming
in from the terrace, found him sprawling over the
table a monumental mass of dejection. But, full of
their own conceits, they did not divine his misery.
Fortinbras smote him friendly wise on his broad back
and aroused him from lethargy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all arranged, <span class='it'>mon vieux</span> Gaspard,” he cried
heartily. “I have been pouring into awakening ears
all the divine distillations of my philosophy. I have
initiated him into mysteries. He is a neophyte of
whom I am proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin, in no mood for allusive hyperbole, shook
himself like a great dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of imbecility are you talking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The late Polydore——” Fortinbras began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Finish with it, I beg you,” interrupted Bigourdin,
with an unusual air of impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a joke, I assure you,” said Martin. “I have
come to the end of my resources. I must work. You
will, sooner or later have to fill the place of Polydore.
Give me the wages of Polydore and I am ready to fill
it. I could not be more incapable, and perhaps I am
a little more intelligent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is serious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As serious as can be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin passed his hand over his face. “I went
to sleep last night in a commonplace world, I wake up
this morning to a fantastic universe in which I seem
to be a leaf, like those outside”—he threw a dramatic
arm—“driven by the wind. I don’t know whether I
am on my head or my heels. Arrange things as seems
best to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You accept me then as waiter in the Hôtel des
Grottes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon cher</span>,” said Bigourdin, “in the state of upheaval
in which I find myself I accept everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The upheaval or rather overthrow—for he used the
word “<span class='it'>bouleversement</span>”—of the big man was evident.
He sat the dejected picture of defeat. No man in the
throes of sea-sickness ever cared less what happened
to him. Fortinbras looked at him shrewdly and his
thick lips formed themselves into a noiseless whistle.
Then he exchanged a glance with Martin, who suddenly
conjectured the reason of Bigourdin’s depression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ought to be spanked,” said he in English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras beamed on him. “You do owe something
to me, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lot,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise, her face full of affairs of high importance
ran into the <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon Oncle</span>, le Père Didier sends word that he has
decided not to kill his calf till next week. What shall
we do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll eat asparagus,” Bigourdin replied and lumbered
out into the November drizzle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three pairs of wondering eyes sought among themselves
a solution of this enigmatic utterance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais qu’est-ce que cela veut dire?</span>” cried Félise,
with pretty mouth agape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means, my child,” said Fortinbras, “that your
uncle, with a philosopher’s survey of the destiny of the
brute creation, refuses to be moved either to ecstatic
happiness or to ignoble anger by the information that
the life of the obscure progeny of a bull and a cow has
been spared for seven days. For myself I am glad.
So is our tender-hearted Martin. So are you. The
calf has before him a crowded week of frisky life.
Send word to Père Didier that we are delighted to hear
of his decision and ask him to crown the calf with
flowers and send him along to-day for afternoon tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled and waved a dismissing hand. Félise,
laughing, kissed him on the forehead and tripped
away, having little time to spare for pleasantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men smoked in silence for some time. At
last Fortinbras, throwing the butt end of his cigarette
into Corinna’s coffee-bowl, rose, stretched himself
and yawned heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having now accomplished my benevolent purpose,”
said he, “I shall retire and take some well-earned repose.
In the meanwhile, Monsieur Polydore Martin,
you had better enter upon your new duties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin, after he had procured a tray and an
apron from the pantry, took off his coat, turned up his
shirt-sleeves and set to work to clear away the breakfast
things.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>B</span><span class='sc'>EHOLD</span> Martin, the professor, transformed into
the perfect waiter—perfect, at least, in zeal,
manner and habiliment. His dress suit, of ardent
cut but practically unworn, gave the <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>
an air of startling refinement and prosperity. At
first Bigourdin, embarrassed by the shifting of the relative
position, had deprecated this outer symbol of
servitude. A man could wait in a lounge suit just as
well as in a tail-coat—a proposition which Fortinbras
vehemently controverted. He read his perplexed
brother-in-law a lecture on the psychology of clothes.
They had a spiritual significance, bringing subjective
and objective into harmony. A judge could not devote
his whole essence to the administration of justice if he
were conscious of being invested in the glittering guise
of a harlequin. If Martin wore the tweeds of the
tourist he would feel inharmonious with his true waiter-self,
and therefore could not wait with the perfect
waiter’s spiritual deftness. Besides, he had not counselled
his disciple to wait as an amateur. The way of
the amateur was perdition. No, when Martin threw
his napkin under his left arm, he should flick a bit of
his heart into its folds, like a true professional.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arrange it as you like,” said the weary Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras arranged and Martin became outwardly
the perfect waiter. Of the craft itself he had much
to learn, chiefly under the guidance of Bigourdin and
sometimes under the shy instruction of Félise. Its
many calls on intelligence and bodily skill surprised
him. To balance a piled-up tray on one bent-back
hand required the art of a juggler. He practised for
days with a trayful of bricks before he trusted himself
with plates and dishes. By means of this exercise
his arm became muscular. He discovered that the
long, grave step of the professor—especially when he
bore a load of eatables—did not make for the perfect
waiter’s celerity. He acquired the gentle arts of salad
making and folding napkins into fantastic shapes.
Never handy with his fingers, and, like most temperate
young men in London lodgings, unaccustomed to the
corkscrew, he found the clean prestidigitation of cork-drawing
a difficult accomplishment. But he triumphed
eventually in this as in all other branches of his new
industry. And he liked it. It amused and interested
him. It was work of which he could see the result.
The tables set before the meal bore testimony to his
handicraft. Never had plate been so polished, cutlery
so lustrous, glass so transparent in the hundred years
history of the Hôtel des Grottes. And when the guests
assembled it was a delight to serve them according
to organised scheme and disarm criticism by demonstration
of his efficiency. He rose early and went to
bed late, tired as a draught-dog and slept the happy
sleep of the contented human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin praised him, but shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you are doing it for, <span class='it'>mon ami</span>, I can’t
imagine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the good of my soul,” laughed Martin, “and
in order to attain happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our good friends the English are a wonderful
race,” said Bigourdin, “and I admire them enormously,
but there’s not one of them who isn’t a little bit mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the coterie of the Café de l’Univers, however,
he gave a different explanation altogether of Professor
Martin’s descent in the social scale. The Professor,
said he, had abandoned the <span class='it'>professoriat</span> for the
more lucrative paths of commerce and had decided to
open a hotel in England, where every one knew the
hotels were villainous and provided nothing for their
clients but overdone bacon and eggs and raw beef-steaks.
The Professor, more enlightened than his compatriots,
was apprenticing himself to the business in
the orthodox Continental fashion. As the substantial
Gaspard Bigourdin himself, son of the late equally substantially,
although one-armed and one-legged Armédée
Bigourdin, had, to the common knowledge of Brantôme,
served as scullion, waiter, <span class='it'>sous-chef de cuisine</span>,
<span class='it'>sous-maître d’hôtel</span>, and bookkeeper at various hotels
in Lyons, in order to become the <span class='it'>bon hôtelier</span> that he
was, his announcement caused no sensation whatever.
The professor of the <span class='it'>Ecole Normale</span> bewailed his own
chill academic lot and proclaimed Monsieur Martin
an exceedingly lucky fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, <span class='it'>mon cher patron</span>, it isn’t true what you have
said at the Café de l’Univers,” protested Martin, when
Bigourdin told him of the explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin waved his great arm. “How am I to
know it isn’t true? How am I to get into the English
minds of you and my <span class='it'>farceur</span> of a brother-in-law so
as to discover why you arrive as an honoured guest at
my hotel and then in the wink of an eye become the
waiter of the establishment? What am I to say to
our friends? They wouldn’t care a hang (<span class='it'>ils se ficheraient
pas mal</span>) for your soul. If you are to continue
to mix with them on terms of equality they must have
an explanation, <span class='it'>nom de Dieu</span>, which they can understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never dreamed,” said Martin, “of entering the
circle at the Café again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais, j’y ai pensé, moi, animal!</span>” cried Bigourdin.
“Because you have the fantasy of becoming my waiter,
are you any less the same human being I had the
pleasure of introducing to my friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, perhaps for the first time, Martin appreciated
his employer’s fine kindness and essential loyalty.
It would have been quite easy for the innkeeper
to dismiss his waiter from the consideration of the
hierarchy of Brantôme as a mad Englishman, an adventurer,
not a professor at all, but a broken-down
teacher of languages giving private lessons—an
odd-job instructor who finds no respect in highly centralised,
bureaucratic France; but the easy way was
not the way of Gaspard Bigourdin. So Martin, driven
by <span class='it'>force majeure</span>, lent himself to the pious fraud and,
when the evening’s work was done, divested himself
of his sable panoply of waiterdom and once more took
his place in the reserved cosy corner of the Café de
l’Univers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The agreeable acidity in his life which he missed
when Corinna, graciously dignified, had steamed off
by the night train, he soon discovered in the pursuit
of his new avocation. Euphémie, the cook, whose surreptitious
habits of uncleanliness carefully hidden from
Félise, but unavoidably patent to an agonised Martin,
supplied as much sourness as his system required. She
would not take him seriously and declared her antipathy
to <span class='it'>un monsieur</span> in her kitchen. To bring about
an <span class='it'>entente cordiale</span> was for Martin an education in
diplomacy. The irritability of a bilious commercial
traveller, poisoned by infected nourishment at his last
house of entertainment—the reason invariably given
for digestive misadventure—so that his stomach was
dislocated, often vented itself on the waiter serving an
irreproachable repast at the Hôtel des Grottes. The
professional swallowing of outraged feelings also gave
a sub-acid flavour to existence. Motorists on the
other hand, struck by his spruceness and polite demeanour,
administered pleasant tonic in the form of
praise. They also bestowed handsome tips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These caused him some misgiving. A gentleman
could be a waiter or anything you pleased, so long as
it was honest, and remain a gentleman: but could he
take tips? Or rather, having taken tips, was it consonant
with his gentility to retain them? Would it
not be nobler to hand them over to Baptiste or
Euphémie? Bigourdin, appealed to, decided that it
would be magnificent but would inevitably disorganise
these excellent domestics. Martin suggested the <span class='it'>Assistance
Publique</span> or the church poor-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought,” said Bigourdin, “you became a waiter
in order to earn your living?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so,” replied Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Bigourdin, “earn it like a waiter.
Suppose I were the manager of a Grand Hotel and
gave you nothing at all—as it is your salary is not that
of a prince—how would you live? You are a servant
of the public. The public pays you for your services.
Why should you be too proud to accept payment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But a tip’s a tip,” Martin objected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good money,” said Bigourdin. “Keep your
fine five-franc pieces in your pocket and <span class='it'>elles feront des
petits</span>, and in course of time you will build with them
an hotel on the Côte d’Azur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter to Corinna, Martin mentioned the disquieting
problem. Chafing in her crowded vicarage
home she offered little comfort. She made the sweeping
statement that whether he kept his tips or not, the
whole business was revolting. He wrote to Fortinbras.
The Dealer in Happiness replied on a postcard:
“Will you never learn that a sense of humour
is the beginning and end of philosophy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After which, Martin, having schooled himself to the
acceptance of <span class='it'>pourboires</span>, learned to pocket them with
a professional air and ended by regarding them as
part of the scheme of the universe. As the heavens
rained water on the thirsty fields, so did clients shower
silver coins on hungry waiters. How far, as yet, it
was good for his soul he could not determine. At any
rate, in his mild, unambitious way, he attained the
lower rungs of happiness. I do not wish it to be understood
that if he had entered as a stranger, say, the
employment of the excellent proprietor of the excellent
Hôtel de Commerce at Périgueux, he would have
found the same contentment of body and spirit. The
alleviations of the Hôtel des Grottes would have been
missing. His employer, while acknowledging his efficiency
still regarded him as an eccentric professor,
and apart from business relations treated him as friend
and comrade. The notables of the town accepted him
as an equal. To the cave-dwellers and others of the
proletariat with whom he had formed casual acquaintance,
he was still “Monsieur Martin,” greeted with
the same shade of courteous deference as before, although
the whole population of Brantôme knew of
his social metamorphosis. Wherever he went, in his
walks abroad, he met the genial smile and raised hat.
He contrasted it all with the dour unwelcome of the
North London streets. There he had always felt lost,
a drab human item of no account. Here he had an
identity, pleasantly proclaimed. So would a sensitive
long-sentence Convict, B 2278, coming into the world
of remembering men, rejoice that he was no longer
a number, but that intensely individual entity Bill
Smith, recognised as a lover of steak-and-kidney pudding.
As a matter of fact, he seldom heard his surname.
The refusal of Bigourdin’s organs of speech to
grapple with the Saxon “Overshaw” has already been
remarked upon. From the very first Bigourdin decreed
that he should be “Monsieur Martin”—Martin
pronounced French fashion—and as “Monsieur Martin”
he introduced him to the Café de l’Univers, and
“Monsieur Martin” he was to all Brantôme. But of
what importance is a surname, when you are intimately
known by your Christian name to all of your acquaintance?
Who in the world save his mother and the
Hastings family had for dreary ages past called him
“Martin”? Now he was “Martin”—or “Monsieur
Martin”—a designation which agreeably combined
familiarity with respect—to all who mattered in Périgord.
It must be remembered that it was an article of
faith among the good Brantômois that, in Périgord,
only Brantôme mattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You people are far too good to me,” he remarked
one day to Bigourdin. “It is a large-hearted country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I not say, my friend,” replied Bigourdin,
“that Périgord would take you to her bosom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then there was Félise, who in her capacity of
task-mistress called him peremptorily “Martin”; but
out of official hours nearly always prefixed the “Monsieur.”
She created an atmosphere of grace around
the plates and dishes, her encouraging word sang
for long afterwards in his ears. With a tact only to
be found in democratic France she combined the authority
of the superior with the intellectual inferior’s
respect. Apparently she concerned herself little about
his change of profession. Her father, the all-wise
and all-perfect, had ordained it; her uncle, wise and
perfect, had acquiesced; Martin, peculiarly wise
and almost perfect, had accepted it with enthusiasm.
Who was she to question the doings of inscrutable
men?</p>

<p class='pindent'>They met perforce more often than during his
guesthood, and, their common interests being multiplied,
their relations became more familiar. They
had reached now the period of the year’s stress, that
of the great <span class='it'>foie gras</span> making when fatted geese were
slain and the masses of swollen liver were extracted
and the huge baskets of black warty truffles were
brought in from the beech forests where they had been
hunted for by pigs and dogs. Martin, like every one
else in the household, devoted all his spare moments
to helping in the steaming kitchen supervised by a
special chef, and in the long, clean-smelling work-room
where rows of white-aproned girls prepared and
packed the delectable compound. Here Bigourdin presided
in brow-knit majesty and Félise bustled a smiling
second in command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well to learn everything,” she said to Martin.
“Who knows when you may be glad to have been
taught how to make <span class='it'>pâté de foie gras</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin, though such a course was not contemplated
in his agreement with the Hôtel des Grottes, received
much instruction from her in the delicate craft,
which was very pleasant indeed. And the girls looked
on at the lessons after the way of their kind and exchanged
glances one with another, and every one,
save perhaps Bigourdin, who had not yet recovered
his serenity overclouded by Corinna’s rejection of his
suit, was exceedingly contented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, lo and behold, into this terrestrial paradise
strayed the wandering feet of Lucien Viriot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not that Lucien was unexpected. His father, Monsieur
Viriot, <span class='it'>marchand de vins en gros</span>, and one of the
famous circle at the Café de l’Univers, had for the
past month or two nightly proclaimed the approaching
release of the young man from military service. Martin
had heard him. Bigourdin on their walks home
together had dilated on the heaven-decreed union of
the two young people and the loneliness of his lot.
Where would he find, at least, such a <span class='it'>ménagère</span> as
Félise?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a pity Corinna hadn’t any sense,” said Martin
on one of these occasions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin heaved a mighty sigh. “Ah, <span class='it'>mon vieux</span>!”
said he by way of answer. The sigh and the “Ah,
<span class='it'>mon vieux</span>!” were eloquent of shattered ideals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is always Madame Thuillier who used to
help me when Félise was little,” he continued after a
while, meditatively. “She has experience, but she is
as ugly as a monkey, the poor woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon he sighed again, leaving Martin in
doubt as to the exact position he intended the ill-favoured
lady to occupy in his household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyhow, Martin was forewarned of the ex-warrior’s
advent. So was Félise. “But I cannot leave
you, <span class='it'>mon oncle</span>,” she cried in dismay. “What would
become of you? Who would mend your linen? What
would become of the hotel? What would become of
the fabrique?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah!” said he, snapping his fingers at such insignificant
considerations. “There is always the <span class='it'>brave</span>
Madame Thuillier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought you detested her—as much as you
can detest anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken, <span class='it'>mon enfant</span>,” replied Bigourdin.
“I have a great regard for her. She has striking
qualities. She is a woman of ripe age and much common
sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which shows how double-tongued men may be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est une vieille pimbèche!</span>” cried Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tais-toi</span>,” said Bigourdin severely. For a “<span class='it'>vieille
pimbèche</span>” means, at the very least, a horrid old tabby
with her claws out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t be silent,” laughed Félise rebelliously.
“<span class='it'>C’est une vieille pimbèche</span>, and I’m not going to leave
you to her. I don’t want to leave you. I don’t want
to marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what all little girls say,” replied Bigourdin.
“But when you see Lucien return, <span class='it'>joli garçon</span>, holding
his head in the air like a brave little soldier of France,
and looking at you out of his honest eyes, you will no
longer tell me, ‘<span class='it'>Je ne veux pas me marier, mon oncle</span>.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed at his outrageous mimicry of a modest
little girl’s accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s true all the same,” she retorted. “I don’t want
to marry anybody, and Lucien after having seen all
the pretty girls of Paris won’t want to marry me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he doesn’t——!” cried Bigourdin threateningly.
“If he dares——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what then?” asked Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have a serious conversation with his father,”
declared Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus both Martin and Félise, as I have said, were
forewarned. Yet neither took much notice of the
warning. Martin had been aware, all along, of the
destiny decreed for her by the omnipotent Triumvirate
consisting of her uncle, the bon Dieu and Monsieur
Viriot, and, regarding her as being sealed to another,
had walked with Martin-like circumspection (subject,
in days not long since past, for Corinna’s raillery)
along the borderline of the forbidden land of tenderness.
But this judicious and conscientious skirting had
its charm. I would have you again realise that the
eternal feminine had entered his life only in the guise:
first, of the kissed damsel who married the onion-loving
plumber; secondly, of Corinna, by whose “Bo!”
he had been vastly terrified until he had taken successfully
to saying “Bo!” himself, a process destructive of
romantic regard; and thirdly, of Félise, a creature—he
always remembered Fortinbras’s prejudiced description—“like
one of the wild flowers from which Alpine
honey is made,” and compact of notable, gentle and
adorable qualities. Naturally, of the three, he preferred
Félise. Félise, for her part, like the well brought
up damsel of the French bourgeoisie, never allowed
her eyelids to register the flutterings of the heart
which the mild young Englishman’s society set in action.
She scarcely admitted the flutterings to herself.
Possibly, if he had been smitten with a fine
frenzy of love-making, she would have been shocked.
But as he shewed respectful gratification at being allowed
to consort with her and gratitude for her little
bits of sympathetic understanding, and as she found
she could talk with him more spontaneously than with
any other young man she had ever met, she sought
rather than avoided the many daily opportunities for
pleasant intercourse. And there was not the least
harm in it; and the bogey of a Lucien (whom she
had liked well enough, years ago in a childish way)
was still hundreds of miles from Brantôme. In fact
they entered upon as pretty a Daphnis and Chloe idyll
as ever was enacted by a pair of innocents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, one fine day, as I have stated, in swaggered
Lucien Viriot, ex-cuirassier, and spoiled the whole
thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His actual hour of swaggering into Martin’s ken
was unexpected—by Martin, at any rate. He was playing
backgammon with the Professor of the <span class='it'>Ecole
Normale</span> in the midst of elders discussing high matters
of local politics, when all of a sudden an uproar
arose among these grave and reverend seniors, clapping
of hands and rattling on tables, and Martin, looking
up from his throw of the dice, perceived the stout,
square-headed, close-cropped Monsieur Viriot, <span class='it'>marchand
de vins en gros</span>, his eyes sparkling and his cheeks
flushed above his white moustache and imperial, advancing
from the café door, accompanied by his square-headed,
close-cropped, sturdy, smiling, swaggeringly-sheepish,
youthful replica. And when they reached the
group, the young man bowed punctiliously before
grasping each outstretched hand; and every one called
him “<span class='it'>mon brave</span>” to which he replied “<span class='it'>bien aimable</span>”;
and Monsieur Viriot presented him formally—“<span class='it'>mon
his qui vient de terminer son service militaire</span>”—to
Monsieur Beuzot, <span class='it'>Professor à l’Ecole Normale</span>, a newcomer
to Brantôme, and to Monsieur Martin, <span class='it'>ancien
professeur anglais</span>. Whereupon Monsieur Lucien Viriot
declared himself enchanted at meeting the two
learned gentlemen, and the two learned gentlemen reciprocated
the emotion of enchantment. Then amid
scuffling of chairs and eager help of waiters, room was
made for Monsieur Viriot and Monsieur Lucien; and
the proprietor of the café, Monsieur Cazensac, swarthy,
portly and heavy-jowled, a Gascon from Agen, who,
if the truth were known took the good, easy folk of
Périgord under his protection, came up from behind
the high bottle-armamented counter, where Madame
Cazensac, fat and fair, prodigally beamed on the
chance of a ray reaching the hero of the moment—which
happened indeed before Cazensac could get in a
word, and brought Lucien to his feet in a splendid
spread of homage to the lady—Monsieur Cazensac, I
say, came up and grasped Lucien by the hand and
welcomed him back to the home of his fathers. He
turned to Monsieur Viriot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur orders——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Du vin de champagne.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happy land of provincial France where you order
champagne as you order brandy and soda and are contented
when you get it. There is no worry about brand
or vintage or whether the wine is <span class='it'>brut</span> or <span class='it'>extra-sec</span>.
You just tell the good landlord to bring you champagne
and he produces the sweet, sticky, frothy, genuine
stuff, and if you are a Frenchman, you are perfectly
delighted. It is champagne, the wine of feasts, the
wine of ceremony, the wine of ladies, the wine of
toasts—<span class='it'>Je lève mon verre</span>. If the uplifted glass is not
beaded with bubbles winking at the brim, what
virtue is there in the uplifting? It is all a symbolical
matter of sparkle.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So, at the Café de l’Univers,
Monsieur Cazensac disappeared portentously, and a
few moments later re-appeared ever so much more portentously,
followed by two waiters, one bringing the
foot-high sacred glasses, the other the uncorked bottles
labelled for all who wished to know what they
were drinking: “Grand Champagne d’Ay,” with the
vine-proprietor’s name inconspicuously printed in the
right-hand bottom corner. All, including Monsieur
Cazensac, clinked foaming glasses with Lucien, and,
after they had sipped in his honour, they sipped again
to the cries of “<span class='it'>Vive l’Armée</span>” and “<span class='it'>Vive la France</span>,”
whereupon they all settled down comfortably again to
the enjoyment of replenished goblets of the effervescing
syrup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin looked with some envy at the young man
who sat flushed with his ovation and twisted his black
moustache to the true cuirassier’s angle, yet bore himself
modestly among his elders. Willing and gay of
heart he had given the years of his youth to the service
of his country; when the great struggle should come—and
all agreed it was near—he would be one of the
first to be summoned to defend her liberty, and willing
and gay of heart he would ride to his death. And
now, in the meanwhile, he had returned to the little
square hole in France that had been ordained for him
(little square peg) before he was born, and was to be
reserved for him as long as his life should last. And
Martin looked again at the chosen child of destiny,
and this time with admiration, for he knew him to be
a man; a man of the solid French stock that makes
France unshakable, of the stock that in peace may be
miserly of its pence, but in war is lavish of its blood.
“I am not that young fellow’s equal,” thought Martin
humbly; and he felt glad that he had not betrayed
Bigourdin’s trust with regard to Félise. What kind
of a wretch would he have been to set himself up as
a rival to Lucien Viriot? Bigourdin had been right
in proclaiming the marriage as arranged by the bon
Dieu. He loved Félise—who knowing her did not?
But he loved her in brotherly fashion and could reconcile
it to his heart to bestow her on one so worthy.
And all this without taking into account the sentiments
of Félise. Her heart, in military phrase, was a
<span class='it'>ville ouverte</span>. Lucien had but to march in and take
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while Lucien, having looked about the café,
rose and went from table to table where sat those
citizens who, by reason of lowlier social status or personal
idiosyncrasies, had not been admitted into the
Inner Coterie of Notables, and greeted old acquaintances.
Monsieur Viriot then caught Martin’s eye and
lifted his glass again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A votre santé</span>, Monsieur Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin bowed. “<span class='it'>A la vôtre, monsieur!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope that you and my son will be good friends.
It is important that the youth of our two countries,
so friendly, so intimately bound, should learn to know
and appreciate each other; especially when one of them,
like yourself, has the power of translating England
into terms of France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with the courteous simplicity of a grey, square-headed,
close-cropped <span class='it'>marchand de vins en gros</span>, he
lifted his glass again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A l’Entente Cordiale.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Lucien returned to the circle, his father re-introduced
him to Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact,” he concluded, “here is an Englishman
who not only speaks French like you and me, but eats
truffles and talks the idiom of the quarrymen and is
qualifying himself to be a good Périgordin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was charmingly said. The company hummed approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est bien vrai</span>,” said Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucien again bowed. He would do himself the honour
of presenting himself at monsieur’s hotel. Monsieur
was doubtless staying at the Hôtel des Grottes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Bigourdin has taken me as a waiter into
his service,” replied Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ah! Tant mieux!</span>” exclaimed Lucien, as if the
announcement were the most ordinary one in the world,
and shook hands with him heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like that, as my father says, one becomes a good
Périgordin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin went home and contentedly to bed. Again
a little corner of the earth that he might call his own
was offered him in this new land so courteous to, yet
so sensitively aloof from the casual Englishman, but
on the other hand, so generous and hospitable to the
Englishman into whom the spirit of France had entered.
Was there here, thought he, the little round hole
which he, little round peg, after thirty years of square-holed
discomfort, had been pre-ordained to fill? The
thought soothed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He woke up in the night, worried by some confused
dream. In his head stuck the Latin tag: <span class='it'>Ubi bene ibi
patria</span>. He kicked indignantly against the aphorism.
It was the infamous philosophy of the Epicurean opportunist.
If he had been comfortable in Germany
would he regard Germany as his fatherland? A million
times no. When you wake up at four o’clock in
the morning to a soul-stirring proposition, you think
in terms of millions. He was English of the English.
His Swiss motherdom was but an accident of begetting.
He was of his father’s race. Switzerland did
not exist in his being as a national influence. English,
narrowly, stupidly, proudly, he was and English he
would remain to the end of time. To denaturalise
himself and become a Frenchman—still less a mere
Périgordin—was abhorrent. But to remain an Englishman,
and as an Englishman—an obscure and menial
Englishman—to be given the freedom of a province
of old France was an honour of which any man
breathing the breath of life might be justly proud.
I can, thought he, in the intense, lunatic clarity of four
o’clock in the morning, show France what England
stands for. I have a chance of one in a million. I am
an Englishman given a home in the France that I am
learning to love and to understand, I am a hyphen
between the two nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having settled that, he turned over, tucked the bed-clothes
well round his shoulders and went soundly to
sleep again.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span><h1>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span> <span class='sc'>FEW</span> evenings afterwards Bigourdin gave a
dinner of ceremony to the Viriots—and a dinner
of ceremony in provincial France is a very
ceremonious and elaborate affair. All day long there
had been anxious preparations. Félise abandoning
the <span class='it'>fabrique</span>, toiled assiduously with Euphémie, while
Bigourdin, expert chef like all good hotel-keepers, controlled
everything with his master touch. The crazily
ceremonious hour of seven-thirty was fixed upon; not
only on account of its ceremoniousness, but because
by that time the commercial travellers would have finished
their meal and melted away. The long middle
table was replaced by a round table prodigally adorned
with flowers and four broad tricolour ribbons, each
like the sash of Monsieur le Maire, radiating from
under a central silver épergne laden with fruit of
which a pineapple was the crown. A bewildering number
of glasses of different shapes stood at each place,
to be filled each kind in its separate order with the
wine ordained for each separate course. Martin rehearsed
the wine service over and over again with a
solemn Bigourdin. As a lieutenant he had the <span class='it'>plongeur</span>
(or washer-up of glass and crockery) from the
Café de l’Univers, an earnest neophyte tense with the
excitement of practising a higher branch of his profession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hosts and guests were ceremoniously attired; Bigourdin
and the elder Viriot suffocated in tightly
buttoned frock-coats of venerable and painful fit;
Lucien, more dashing, wore a morning coat (last
cry of Bond Street) acquired recently from the “High
Life” emporium in Paris; all three men retained yellow
dogskin gloves until they sat down to table. Madame
Viriot, stout and placid, appeared in her black
silk dress and an old lace collar and her very best hat
with her very best black ostrich feather secured by the
old rose-diamond buckle, famous throughout the valley
of the Dordogne, which had belonged to her great-great-grandmother;
and, lastly, Félise wore a high-necked
simple frock of dazzling whiteness which might
have shewn up her delicate dark colouring had not
her cheeks been inordinately pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin had Madame Viriot on his right, Monsieur
Viriot on his left, and Félise sat between Monsieur
Viriot and Lucien. Every one was most ceremoniously
polite. It was “<span class='it'>mon cher</span> Viriot,” and
“<span class='it'>mon cher</span> Bigourdin,” and the formal “<span class='it'>vous</span>” instead
of the “<span class='it'>mon vieux</span>” and the “<span class='it'>tu</span>” of the café and
of ordinary life; also, “<span class='it'>chère madame</span>,” and “Monsieur
Lucien” and “<span class='it'>ma nièce</span>.” And although from
childhood Félise and Lucien had called each other
by their Christian names, it was now “monsieur” and
“mademoiselle” between them. You see, marriage is
in France a deuce of a ceremony which begins months
before anybody dreams of setting the wedding bells
a-ringing. This dinner of ceremony was the first
scene of the first act of the elaborate drama which
would end on the curtain being run down to the aforesaid
wedding-bells. Really, when one goes into the
question, and considers all the barbed wire entanglements
that French law and custom interpose between
two young people who desire to become man and wife,
one not only wonders how any human pair can go
through the ordeal and ever marry at all, but is
profoundly convinced that France is the most moral
country on the face of the globe. As a matter of fact,
it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long meal of many courses. Martin, aided
by the <span class='it'>plongeur</span>, acquitted himself heroically. Manners
professional and individual, and also the strain
of service prevented him from attending to the conversation.
But what he could not avoid overhearing
did not impress him with its brilliance. It was a self-conscious
little company. It threw about statistics as
to the state of the truffle crop; it listened to Lucien’s
modest anecdotes of his military career; it decided that
Parisians were greatly to be pitied in that fate compelled
them to live in Paris instead of Brantôme. Even
the flush of good cheer failed to inspire it with heartiness.
For this perhaps the scared unresponsiveness
of one of the chief personages was responsible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you fond of dogs, mademoiselle?” asked Lucien,
valiant in small talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oui, monsieur</span>,” replied Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any now, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Non, monsieur</span>,” replied Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The beautiful poodle that was so clever is dead, I
believe,” remarked Madame Viriot in support of her
son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oui, madame</span>,” replied Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However alluring to the young Frenchman about
to marry may be timid innocence with downcast eyes,
yet, when it is to such a degree monosyllabic, conversation
does not sparkle. Martin, accustomed to her
tongue wagging charmingly, wondered at her silence.
What more attractive companion could she desire than
the <span class='it'>beau sabreur</span> by her side? And she ate next to
nothing. When she was about to decline a <span class='it'>bécasse au
fumet</span>, as to the success of which Euphémie’s heart was
beating like a sledge-hammer, he whispered in her
ear,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a little bit. Do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as she helped herself, he saw the colour mount
to her neck. He felt quite pleased at having prevailed
on her to take nourishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What happened after the meal in the private salon,
where Félise, according to sacred rite, served coffee
and liqueurs, Martin did not know. He was too busy
with Euphémie and the chambermaid and Baptiste and
the <span class='it'>plongeur</span> in cleaning up after the banquet. Besides,
as the waiter of the establishment, what should he have
been doing in that ceremonious gathering?</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the work was finished and a concluding orgy
on broken meats and half emptied bottles had been
temperately concluded, and Euphémie for the hundredth
time had been informed of the exact appreciation
which each particular dish had received from
Monsieur and Madame Viriot—“young people, you
see,” she explained, “have their own affairs and they
see everything rose-coloured, and you could give them
boiled horse-liver and they wouldn’t know the difference
between that and <span class='it'>ris-de-veau à l’Impériale</span>; it
doesn’t matter what you put into the stomachs of
children; but with old, serious folks, it is very important.
I made the stomach of Monsieur Viriot the
central idea of my dinner—I have known the stomach
of Monsieur Viriot for twenty years—also that of
Madame, for old ladies, <span class='it'>voyez-vous</span>, know more than
you think”—and when the weary and zealous servants
had gone their separate ways, Martin locked up, and,
escaping from the generous atmosphere of the kitchen,
entered the dimly lit vestibule with the idea of smoking
a quiet cigarette before going to bed. There he found
Bigourdin, sprawling his great bulk over the cane-seated
couch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did things go all right?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderfully. Everybody dined well. They can
go to the <span class='it'>ban</span> and <span class='it'>arrière-ban</span> of their friends and relations
and say that there is not such a <span class='it'>cuisine</span> in Périgord
as at the Hôtel des Grottes. And the service was
excellent. Not the smallest hitch. I congratulate you
and thank you, <span class='it'>mon ami</span>. But <span class='it'>ouf</span>!”—he took a great
breath of relief—“I am glad it is over. I was not built
for the formalities of society. <span class='it'>Ça vous fatigue!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s also fatiguing from the waiter’s point of view,”
laughed Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is all necessary when one has a young girl
to marry. The father and mother of the young man
expect it. It is very complicated. Soon there will be
the formal demand in marriage. They will wear
gloves—<span class='it'>c’est idiot</span>—but what would you have? It is
the custom. And then there will be a dinner of ceremony
at the Viriots’. He has some Chambertin in his
cellar, my old friend Viriot—ah, <span class='it'>mon petit</span> Martin!”—he
blew a kiss to the purple goddess beloved of Bacchus
and by him melted into each cobwebbed bottle—“It
is the only thing that reconciles me to it. Truth
to say, one dines abominably at the Viriots. If he
does not produce some of that Chambertin, I withdraw
the dowry of Félise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all arranged then?” Martin asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Monsieur Lucien has been accepted by
Mademoiselle Félise? I mean, he has proposed to her,
as we English say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais non!</span>” cried Bigourdin, with a shocked air.
“Lucien is a correctly brought up young man and
would not offend the proprieties in that matter. It is
not the affair of Lucien and Félise, it is the affair of
the two families, the parents; and for Félise I am <span class='it'>in
loco parentis</span>. Propose to Félise! What are you talking
about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all interests me so much,” replied Martin. “In
England we manage differently. When a man wants
to marry a girl, he asks her, and when they have fixed
up everything between themselves, they go and announce
the fact to their families.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To which Bigourdin made the amazing answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est le phlègme britannique!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>British phlegm! When a man takes his own unphlegmatic
way with a maid! Martin could find no
adequate retort. He was knocked into a cocked hat.
He threw away his cigarette and, being very tired,
half stifled a yawn. Bigourdin responded mightily
and rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Allons dodo</span>,” said he. “All this has been terribly
fatiguing.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>So fatiguing had it all been that Félise, for the first
time since the chicken-pox and measles of childhood,
remained in her bed the next day. Euphémie, her
personal attendant, found her in the morning a wan
ghost with a splitting headache, and forbade her to
rise. She filled her up with <span class='it'>tilleul</span>, the decoction of
lime-leaves which in French households is the panacea
for all ills, and, good and comfortable gossip, extolled,
in Gallic hyperbole, the dazzling qualities of
Monsieur Lucien. At last, fever-eyed and desperate,
Félise sat up in bed and pointed to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ma bonne Euphémie, laisse-moi tranquille! Va-t’en!
Fich’-moi la paix!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Euphémie gaped in bewilderment. It was as though
a dove had screamed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me alone! Go away! Go to Blazes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ah, la! la! ma pauvre petite!</span>” Euphémie knew
not what she was saying, but she went. She went to
Bigourdin and told him that mademoiselle was in
delirium, she had brain-fever, and if he wanted to save
her reason, he must send at once for the doctor. The
doctor came, diagnosed a chill on the vaguest of symptoms,
and ordered <span class='it'>soupe à l’huile</span>. This invalid fare
is a thin vegetable soup with a layer of salad oil floating
on the top with the object of making the liquid
slip gratefully down the gullet: the French gullet, be
it understood. Félise, in spite of her lifelong French
training, had so much of England lingering in her
œsophagus, that it abhorred <span class='it'>soupe à l’huile</span>. The good
doctor’s advice failed. She fasted in bed all day, declaring
that, headache apart, she was perfectly well,
and the following morning, a wraith of herself, arose
and went about her ordinary avocations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is the matter with her?” asked Bigourdin
of Martin. “Nothing could have disagreed with her
at that abominable dinner, because she didn’t eat anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Martin could throw no light on the sudden malady
of Félise, Bigourdin lit a cigarette and inhaled a
huge puff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It needs a woman, <span class='it'>voyez-vous</span>, to look after a
young girl. Men are no good. There are a heap of
secrets——” With his arms he indicated Mount Blanc
piled on Mount Everest. “I shall be glad when she
is well and duly married. Perhaps the approaching
betrothal affects her. Women have nerves like that.
She is anxious to know the result of the negotiations.
At the present moment the Viriots are free to make or
make not their demand. It would be good to reassure
her a little. What do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin gave utterance to the profound apophthegm:
“There is nothing so upsetting as uncertainty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is my idea!” cried Bigourdin. “Pardon me
for consulting you on these details so intimate and a
little sacred. But you have a clear intelligence and a
loyal heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it came to pass that, after <span class='it'>déjeuner</span>, Bigourdin
took Félise into their own primly and plushily furnished
salon, and, like an amiable bull in a boudoir, proceeded
to smash up the whole of her universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no doubt,” he proclaimed, “Monsieur and
Madame Viriot have dreamed of it for ten years. I
give you a dowry—there is no merit in it, because I
love you like my own daughter—but I give you a
dowry such as there are not many in Périgord. Lucien
loves you. He is <span class='it'>bon garçon</span>. It has never entered
his head to think of another woman for his wife.
It is all arranged. In two or three days—you must
allow for the <span class='it'>convenances</span>—Monsieur Viriot and Lucien
will call on me. So, my dear little angel, do not
be afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise had listened to this, white-faced and hollow-eyed.
“But I don’t want to marry Lucien, <span class='it'>mon oncle</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Comment?</span> You don’t want to marry Lucien?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, <span class='it'>mon oncle</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——” He swept the air with a protesting gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have already told you so,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, <span class='it'>ma chère petite</span>, that wasn’t serious. It was
because you had some stupid and beautiful idea of not
deserting me. That is all imbecile. Young people
must marry, <span class='it'>sacrebleu</span>! so that the race is perpetuated,
and fathers and mothers and uncles don’t count.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what has that to do with it, <span class='it'>mon oncle</span>?” protested
Félise. “I find Lucien very charming; but I
don’t love him. If I loved him, I would marry him.
But as I don’t love him, I can’t marry him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But marry him and you will love him,” cried Bigourdin,
as millions of French fathers and uncles have
cried for the last three or four hundred years. “It is
very simple. What more do you want than a gallant
fellow like Lucien?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, of course, she broke down, and began to cry.
Bigourdin, unused to feminine tears, tried to clutch
his hair. If it had been longer than half an inch of
upstanding bristle, he would have torn it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t understand, <span class='it'>mon oncle</span>,” she sobbed,
with bowed head. “It is only my mother who can advise
me. I must see my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin put his arm round the girl’s slender
shoulders. “Your mother, my poor Félise, sees nobody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her head and flashed out: “She sees my
father. She lives with him in the same house. Why
shouldn’t she see me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tiens, tiens</span>, my little Félise,” said Bigourdin soothingly.
“There is no need for you to consult your
mother. Both your father and your mother have a
long while ago decided that you should marry Lucien.
Do you think I would take a step of which they did
not approve?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A long while ago is not to-day,” sobbed Félise.
“I want to talk to my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin walked across the salon, with his back
to her, and snapped his fingers in peculiar agitation,
and muttered below his breath: “<span class='it'>Nom de Dieu, de
nom de Dieu, de nom de Dieu!</span>” Kindest-hearted of
mortals though he was, he resented the bottom being
knocked out of his scheme of social existence.
For years he had looked forward to this alliance with
the Viriots. Personally he had nothing to gain: on
the contrary, he stood to lose the services of Félise and
a hundred thousand francs. But he had set his heart
on it, and so had the Viriots. To go to them and say,
“My niece refuses to marry your son,” would be a
slash of the whip across their faces. His failure to
bring up a young girl in the proper sentiments would
be a disgrace to him in the eyes of the community.
He felt hurt, too, because he no longer sufficed her;
she wanted her mother; and it was out of the question
that she should go to her mother. No wonder he
swore to himself softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, <span class='it'>mon Dieu</span>,” said he, turning round. “What
have you against Lucien?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon they went over all the argument again.
She did not love Lucien. She didn’t want to marry
Lucien. She would not marry a man she did not love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you will die an old maid,” said Bigourdin.
“An old maid, <span class='it'>figure-toi</span>! It would be terrible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise sniffed at such terrors. Bigourdin, in desperation,
asked what he was to tell the Viriots. “The
truth,” said Félise. But what was the truth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, my little Félise,” said he, gently, “there is,
by chance, no one else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Félise waxed indignant and routed the unhappy
man. She gave him to understand that she was
a <span class='it'>jeune fille bien élevée</span> and was not in the habit of
behaving like a kitchenmaid. It was cruel and insulting
to accuse her of clandestine love-affairs. And
Bigourdin, bound by his honourable conventions, knew
that she was justified in her resentment. Again he
plucked at his bristles, scared by the spectacle of outraged
maidenhood. The tender-eyed dove had become
a flashing little eagle. A wilier man than he might
have suspected the over-protesting damsel. Woman-like,
she pressed her advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon oncle</span>, I love you with all my heart, but you
are a man and you don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is absolutely true,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you see there is only one person I can explain
it to, and that is my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus she completed the vicious little circle. And
again the helpless Bigourdin walked across the salon
and turned his back on her and muttered the incantation
which brings relief to distracted man.
But this time she went up to him and put an
arm round his great body and laid her face against
his sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tu sais, je suis bien malheureuse.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a knife stuck in the honest fellow’s heart. He
caught her to him and in his turn protested vehemently.
He would not allow her to be unhappy. He would cut
off his head rather than allow her to be unhappy. He
would do anything—his French caution forbade an
offer to send the Viriots packing—anything in reason
to bring the colour back to her white cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he had an inspiration which glowed all
over his broad face and caused him to hold her out at
arms’ length and laugh joyously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t see your mother—but there is your good
Aunt Clothilde. She will be a second mother to you.
A woman so pious and so sympathetic. You will be
able to tell her all your troubles. She has married
a regiment of daughters. What she doesn’t know
of young girls isn’t worth knowing. You are tired,
you are ill. You need a change, a little holiday. Go
and spend a month with her, and when you come
back we’ll see what can be done with regard to Lucien.
I’ll write to her now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And without waiting to hear her demure “<span class='it'>Bien, mon
oncle</span>,” he escaped to the <span class='it'>bureau</span> where he should find
the writing materials which did not profane the sacred
primness of the salon, and plunged into correspondence.
Félise, left alone, pondered for a moment or
two, with faint wrinkling of her smooth forehead, and
then, sketching a gesture of fatalistic resignation, went
off to the kitchen, where a great special boiling of goose
livers was in progress. On the way she met Martin
carrying a load of porcelain pots. But she passed
him by coldly; and for the rest of the day she scarcely
threw at him a couple of words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Bigourdin beamed over the letter to his
elder sister Clothilde, a comfortable and almost opulent
widow who lived at Chartres. They had not met
for a dozen years, it is true, and she had only once
seen Félise; but the sense of the family is very strong
in France, especially where marriage alliances are concerned,
and he had no doubt that she would telegraph,
as requested, and authorise him to entrust Félise to
her keeping. Verily it had been an inspiration. It
was a solution of difficulties. The Viriots had given
signs of an almost indecent hurry, which naturally had
scared Félise. A month was a long time. Clothilde
was a woman of experience, tact and good sense. She
would know how to bring Félise to a reasonable state
of mind. If she did not succeed—well—he was not
the man to force his little Félise into a distasteful marriage.
In any case he had a month’s respite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having stated his case at length, he went out into the
town to post such an important letter at the central
<span class='it'>Postes et Télégraphes</span>, and on the way back, looked
in at the shop of the very respectable Madame Chauvet,
who, with her two elderly daughters, sold crucifixes
and rosaries and books of devotion and candles and
all that would supply the devout needs of the religious
population. And after a prolonged and courtly conversation,
he induced Madame Chauvet, in consideration
of their old friendship, her expenses and an honorarium
of twenty francs, to undertake the safe convoy
of Félise from Brantôme to the house of Madame
Robineau, her Aunt Clothilde, at Chartres.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>M</span><span class='sc'>ADAME ROBINEAU</span> was tall, angular, thin-lipped
and devout, and so far as she indulged
in social intercourse, loved to mingle with
other angular, thin-lipped and devout ladies who belonged
to the same lay sisterhood. She dressed in
unrelieved black and always wore on her bosom a
bronze cross of threatening magnitude. She prayed
in the Cathedral at inconvenient hours, and fasted as
rigorously as her Confessor, Monsieur l’Abbé Duloup,
himself. Monsieur l’Abbé regarded her as one of the
most pious women in Chartres. No doubt she was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Félise, although a good Catholic in her very
simple way, and anxious to win favour by observance
of the rules of the solitary household, was wicked
enough to wish that her aunt were not quite so pious.
In religious matters a wide latitudinarianism prevailed
at the Hôtel des Grottes. There, with a serene conscience,
one could eat meat on Fridays and crack a
mild joke at the expense of the good Saint Peter. But
neither forbidden flesh nor jocularity on any subject,
let alone on a saint’s minor foibles, mitigated the austerities
of the perky, wind-swept little house at Chartres.
No wonder, thought Félise, Aunt Clothilde had
married off a regiment of daughters—four to be exact;
it had been an easy matter; she herself would have
married any caricature of a man rather than spend her
life in an atmosphere so rarefied and so depressing.
She pitied her cousins, although, according to her
Aunt Clothilde’s pragmatical account, they were all
doing splendidly and had innumerable babies. By the
end of the first week of her visit, she consolidated an
intense dislike to Chartres and everything in it, especially
the Cathedral. Now, it may be thought that
any one who can shake the fist of disapprobation at
the Cathedral of Chartres, is beyond the pale of human
sympathy. But when you are dragged relentlessly
thither in the icy dark of every winter morning, and
the bitter gloom of every winter evening, to say nothing
of sporadic attendances during the daytime, you
may be pardoned if your æsthetic perceptions are obscured
by the sense of outrage inflicted on your personal
comfort. To many generations of men the
Cathedral has been a symbol of glories, revelations and
eternities. In such slanting shafts of light, mystically
hued, the Grail might have been made manifest, the
Sacred Dove might have glided down to the Head of
the Holy One.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But what need to tell of its spiritual
wonders and of its mystery, the heart of which
it is given to every suffering man to pluck out according
to his own soul’s needs? It was a little tragedy
that to poor Félise the Cathedral symbolised nothing
but an overwhelming tyranny. She hated every stone
of it, as much as she hated every shiny plank and every
polished chair in her aunt’s frigid salon. Even the
streets of Chartres repelled her by their bleakness.
They lacked the smiling homeliness of Brantôme;
and the whole place was flatter than the Sahara. She
sighed for the rocks and hills of Périgord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She also ate the unaccustomed bread of idleness.
Had her aunt permitted, she would delightedly have
helped with the house-work. But Madame Robineau,
widow of a dealer in grain who, before his death, had
retired on a comfortable fortune, lived, according to
her lights, at her ease, her wants being scrupulously
administered to by a cook and a maid. There was no
place in the domestic machine for Félise. Her aunt
passed long chilly hours over ecclesiastical embroidery,
sitting bolt upright in her chair with a <span class='it'>chaufferette</span>
beneath her feet. Félise, unaccustomed needlewoman,
passed longer and chillier hours (having no <span class='it'>chaufferette</span>)
either playing with a grey ascetic cat or reading
aloud <span class='it'>La Croix</span>, the only newspaper allowed to cross
the threshold of the house. Now and again, Madame
Robineau would drop her thin hands into her lap and
regard her disapprovingly. One day she said, interrupting
the reading,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor child, how your education has been
neglected. You scarcely know how to hold a needle,
you can’t read aloud without making faults, and you
are ignorant of the elements of our holy religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Aunt,” Félise replied, “I know how to manage
an hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be of little use to your husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise winced at the unhappy word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am never going to marry, <span class='it'>ma tante</span>,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You surely do not expect to be admitted into a convent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven forbid!” cried Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven would forbid,” said Madame Robineau
severely, “seeing that you have not the vocation. But
the <span class='it'>jeune fille bien élevée</span>”—in the mouth of her Aunt
Clothilde the familiar phrase assumed a detestable significance,
implying, to Félise’s mind, a pallid young
creature from whom all blood and laughter had been
driven by undesirable virtues—“the <span class='it'>jeune fille bien
élevée</span> has only two careers offered to her—the convent
or marriage. For you, my dear child, it is marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Félise, with a smile, preparing, to resume
the article in the newspaper over which she had
stumbled, “perhaps the beautiful prince will come along
one of these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Madame Robineau rebuked her for vain imaginings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true, what I said, that your education has been
neglected. A young girl’s duty is not to look for
princes, but to accept the husband chosen by the wisdom
of her family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ma tante</span>,” said Félise demurely, after a pause
during which her aunt took up her work again. “If
you would teach me how to embroider, perhaps I might
learn to be useful in my future home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this and many other conversations, Félise
began to be aware of the subtle strategy of Bigourdin.
On the plea of providing her with pro-maternal consolation,
he had delivered her into the hands of the
enemy. This became abundantly clear as the days
went on. Aunt Clothilde, incited thereto by her uncle,
was opening a deadly campaign in favour of Lucien
Viriot. Now, the cathedral, though paralysing, could
be borne for a season, and so could the blight that
pervaded the house; but the campaign was intolerable.
If she could have resented the action of one so beloved
as Bigourdin, she would have resented his sending her
to her Aunt Clothilde. Under the chaperonage of
the respectable Madame Chauvet she had fallen into a
pretty trap. She had found none of the promised
sympathy. Aunt Clothilde, although receiving her
with the affectionate hospitality due to a sister’s child,
had from the first interview frozen the genial current
of her little soul. The great bronze cross in itself repelled
her. If it had been a nice, gentle little cross,
rising and falling on a motherly bosom, it would have
worked its all-human, adorable influence. But this
was a harsh, aggressive, come-and-be-crucified sort of
cross, with no suggestion of pity or understanding.
The sallow, austere face above it might have easily
been twisted into such a cross. It conveyed no invitation
to the sufferer to pour out her troubles. Uncle
Bigourdin was wrong again. Rather would Félise
have poured out her troubles into the portentous ear
of the Suisse at the Cathedral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her aunt and herself met nowhere on common
ground. They were for ever at variance. Madame
Robineau spoke disparagingly of the English, because
they were Protestants and therefore heretics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am English, and I am not a heretic,” cried
Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not English,” replied her aunt, “because
you have a French mother and have been brought
up in France. And as for not being a heretic, I am
not so sure. Monsieur l’Abbé Duloup thinks you must
have been brought up among Freemasons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ah non, par exemple!</span>” exclaimed Félise indignantly.
For, in the eyes of the Church, French Freemasons
are dreadful folk, capable of anything sacrilegious,
from denying the miracle of Saint Januarius
to slitting the Pope’s weasand. So—“<span class='it'>Ah! non par
exemple!</span>” cried Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freemasons, indeed! Her Uncle Gaspard, it is true,
did not attend church regularly—but yes, he did attend
regularly—he went once a year, every Easter Sunday,
and he was the best of friends with Monsieur le
Curé of their Paroisse. And as for herself, Monsieur
le Curé, who looked like a venerable saint in the holy
pictures, had always a smile and a <span class='it'>ma chère enfant</span> for
her whenever they met. She was on excellent terms
with Monsieur le Curé; he would no more have
dreamed of associating her with Freemasons than of
accusing her of being in league with devils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a good, common-sensical old curé, like thousands
of the secular clergy in France, and knew how
to leave well alone. Questioned by the ecclesiastically
environed Abbé Duloup as to the spiritual state of
Félise, he would indubitably have answered with serene
conviction:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a soul so pure and so candid, which I have
watched from childhood, is not acceptable to the
<span class='it'>bon Dieu</span>, then I know no more about the <span class='it'>bon Dieu</span>
than I know about the Emperor of Patagonia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Félise, disliking the Abbé Duloup and many
of his works, felt a delicacy in dragging her own curé
into the argument and contented herself with protesting
against the charge of heresy. As a matter of fact,
she proclaimed her Uncle Gaspard was not a Freemason.
He held in abhorrence all secret political societies
as being subversive of the State. No one should
attack her Uncle Gaspard, although he had betrayed
her so shabbily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In vain she sought some link with her aunt. Even
Mimi, the lean old cat, did not form a bond of union.
As a vagrant kitten it had been welcomed years ago
by the late good-natured Robineau, and the widow
tolerated its continued presence with Christian resignation.
Félise took the unloved beast to her heart. From
Aunt Clothilde’s caustic remarks she gathered that
her four cousins, of whose exemplary acceptance of
husbands she had heard so much, had eyed Mimi with
the coldness of their mother. She began to thank
Providence that she did not resemble her cousins,
which was reprehensible; and now and then manifested
a lack of interest in their impeccable doings, which was
more reprehensible still, and thus stirred up against
her the maternal instincts of Madame Robineau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Relations grew strained. Aunt Clothilde spoke to
her with sharp impatience. From her recalcitrance in
the matter of Lucien she deduced every fault conceivable.
For the first time in her life Félise dwelt in
an atmosphere where love was not. She longed for
home. She longed especially for her father and his
wise tenderness. Because she longed so greatly she
could not write to him as a father should be written
to; and the many-paged letters into which, at night,
she put all her aching little heart, in the morning she
blushed at the thought of sending. In spite of his lapse
from grace she could not be so disloyal to the beloved
Uncle Gaspard. Nor could she distress her suffering
angel mother by her incoherent account of things. If
only she could see her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, one dreary afternoon, Madame Robineau
opened an attack in force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put down that cat. I have to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise obeyed and Aunt Clothilde talked. The more
she talked, the more stubborn front did Félise oppose.
Madame Robineau lost her temper. Her thin lips
twitched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I order you,” she said, “to marry Lucien Viriot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry to say anything to vex you, <span class='it'>ma tante</span>,”
replied Félise valiantly; “but you have not the power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I suppose your uncle has not the power to
command you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In matters like that, no, <span class='it'>ma tante</span>,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Clothilde rose from her straight-backed chair
and shook a long, threatening finger. The nail at the
end was also long and not very clean. Félise often
wondered whether her aunt abhorred a nail-brush by
way of mortification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When one considers all the benefits my brother
has heaped on your head,” she cried in a rasping voice,
“you are nothing else than a little monster of ingratitude!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise flared up. She did not lack spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is false,” she cried. “I adore my Uncle Gaspard.
I would give him my life. I am not ungrateful.
It is worse than false.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true,” retorted Madame Robineau. “Otherwise
you would not refuse him the desire of his heart.
Without him you would have not a rag to your back,
or a shoe to your foot, and no more religion than a
heathen. It is to him you owe everything—everything.
Without him you would be in the gutter where
he fished you from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ended on a shrill note. Félise, very pale, faced
her passionately, with a new light in her mild eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean? The gutter? My father——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! Your father! Your vagabond, ne’er-do-weel
scamp of a father! He’s a scandal to the family,
your father. He should never have been born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl reeled. It was a foul bludgeon blow.
Madame Robineau, with quick realisation of folly,
checked further utterance and allowed Félise, white,
quivering and vanquished, but carrying her little head
fiercely in the air, to retire from the scene with all
the honours of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Robineau was sorry. She had lost both
temper and dignity. Her next confession would be an
unpleasant matter. Possibly, however, the Abbé Duloup
would understand and guess the provocation. She
shrugged her lean shoulders. It was good sometimes
for hoity-toity damsels to learn humility. So she sat
down again, pursing her lips, and continued her embroidered
stole until it was the hour of vespers. Contrary
to custom, she did not summon Félise to accompany
her to the Cathedral. An hour or two of solitude,
she thought, not unkindly, would bring her to a more
reasonable frame of mind. She went out alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she returned she found that Félise had left the
house.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very scared young person that presented
herself at the <span class='it'>guichet</span> at the railway station and asked
for a second class ticket to Paris. She had never
travelled alone in her life before. Even on her rare
visits to the metropolis of Périgueux, in whose vast
emporium of fashion she clothed herself, she was attended
by Euphémie or the chambermaid. She felt
lost, a tiny, helpless creature, in the great, high station
in which an engine letting off steam produced a bewildering
uproar. How much she paid for her ticket,
thrifty and practised housekeeper that she was, she
did not know. She clutched the change from a hundred
franc note which, a present from her uncle before
leaving Brantôme, she had preserved intact, and
scuttled like a little brown rabbit to the door of the
<span class='it'>salle d’attente</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Le train de Paris? A quatre heures cinquante</span>,”
said the official at the door, as though this palpitating
adventure were the commonplace of every minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that will be?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cocked an eye at the clock. “In half an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A train was on the point of starting. There was a
scuttle for seats. She felt sure it was the Paris train.
From it emanated the magic influence of the great
city whither she was bound. A questioned porter informed
her it was going in the opposite direction. The
Paris express left at four-fifty. The train steamed
out. It seemed to Félise as though she had lost a
friend. She looked round helplessly, and seeing a fat
peasant woman sitting on a bench, surrounded by bundles
and children, she ran to her side for protection.
It is the unknown that frightens. In the Hôtel des
Grottes she commanded men with the serenity of a
Queen Elizabeth, and as for commercial travellers
and other male visitors, she took no more account of
them than of the geese that she plucked. And the
terrifying Aunt Clothilde had terrified in vain. But
here, in this cold, glass-roofed, steel-strutted, screeching,
ghostly inferno of a place, with men prowling
about like roaring lions seeking probably whom
they might devour, conditions were terrifyingly unfamiliar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet she did not care. Under the blasphemous roof
of her Aunt Clothilde she could not have remained.
For, in verity, blasphemy had been spoken. Her
father was loved and honoured by all the world; by her
mother, by Uncle Gaspard, by Corinna, by Martin.
And she herself—did she not know her father? Was
there ever a man like him? The insulting words rang
through her brain. She would have confronted terrors
a million fold more grisly than these in order to escape
from the blasphemer, whom she could never forgive—no,
not for all the curés and abbés in Christendom.
An intense little soul was that of Félise Fortinbras.
It swept her irresistibly out of the unhallowed villa,
with a handbag containing a nightgown, a toothbrush
and a faded little photograph of her father and mother
standing side by side in wedding garb, on the way to
the dread, fascinating whirlpool of Paris, where dwelt
the worshipped gods of her idolatry. And, as she sat
in the comforting lee of the fat and unafraid peasant
woman and her bundles and her children, she took herself
to task for cowardice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The journey, under two hours, was but a trifle.
Had it been to Brantôme, an all-night affair, she might
have had reason for quailing. But to Paris it was
practically but a step.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Abbé Duloup spoke
of going to Paris as her uncle spoke of going to
Périgueux. Yet her heart thudded violently during
the interminable half hour. And there was the grim
possibility of the appearance of a pursuing Aunt Clothilde.
She kept a fearful eye upon the doorway of
the <span class='it'>salle d’attente</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the train rushed in, and there was clangour
of luggage trucks and clamour of raucous voices announcing
the train for Paris; and a flow of waiting
people, among whom was her neighbour with her
varied impedimenta, swept across the lines and scaled
the heights of the carriages. By luck, in front of
Félise loomed a compartment showing second class
on the door panel and “<span class='it'>Dames seules</span>” on the window.
She clambered in and sank into a seat. Who her
lonely lady fellow-travellers were she could not afterwards
remember; for she kept her eyes closed, absorbed
in the adventure that still lay before her. Yet
it was comforting to feel that as long as the train went
on she was safe in this feminine sanctuary, free from
depredations of marauding males.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paris. One of the ladies, seeing that she was about
to remain in the carriage, jerked the information over
a descending shoulder. Félise followed and stood for
a moment more confused than ever in the blue glare
and ant-hill hurry of the Gare de Montparnasse. A
whole town seemed to have emerged from the train
and to stream like a rout of refugees flying from disaster,
men, women and children, laden with luggage,
towards the barrier. Carried along, she arrived there
at length, gave up her ticket, and, issuing from the
station, found herself in a narrow street, at the end
of which, still following the throng, she came to a
thundering thoroughfare. Never, in all her imaginings
of Paris, had she pictured such a soul-stunning phantasmagoria
of flashing light and flashing movement.
There were millions of faces passing her by on the
pavement, in the illuminated interiors of omnibuses,
in the dimmed recesses of taxi-autos, on waggons, on
carts, on bicycles; millions in gaily lit cafés; before her
dazzled eyes millions seemed to be reflected even in
the quivering, lucent air. She stood at the corner of
the Place de Rennes and the Boulevard de Montparnasse
paralysed with fear, clutching her handbag tight
to her side. In that perilous street thousands of thieves
must jostle her. She could not move a step, overwhelmed
by the immensity of Paris. A good-natured
sergent de ville, possibly the father of pretty daughters,
noticed her agonised distress. It was not his
business to perform unsolicited deeds of knight errantry;
but having nothing else to do for the moment,
he caught her eye and beamed paternal encouragement.
Now a sergent de ville is a <span class='it'>sergent de ville</span> (recognisable
by his uniform) all France over. Félise held
Père Chavrol, who exercised that function at Brantôme,
in high esteem. This policeman had a fat, dark,
grinning, scrubbily-moustached face which resembled
that of Père Chavrol. She took her courage and her
handbag in both hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur,” she said, “can you direct me to the
Rue Maugrabine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He couldn’t. He did not know that street. In what
<span class='it'>quartier</span> was it? Félise was ignorant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est là où demeure mon père</span>,” she added. “<span class='it'>C’est
Monsieur Fortinbras. Tout le monde le connaît à
Paris.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But alas! the sergent de ville had never heard of the
illustrious Fortinbras: which was strange, seeing that
all Brantôme knew him, although he did not live
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What then shall I do, Monsieur,” asked Félise, “to
get to my father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergent de ville pushed his képi to the back of
his head and cogitated. Then, with uplifted hand, he
halted a crawling fiacre. Rue de Maugrabine? Of
course the glazed-hatted, muffled-up driver knew it.
Somewhere between the Rue de la Roquette and the
Avenue de la République. The sergent de ville smiled
vaingloriously. It was only <span class='it'>ces vieux collignons</span>, old
drivers of fiacres, that knew their Paris, he explained.
The chauffeur of a taxi-auto would have been ignorant
of the whereabouts of the Arc de Triomphe. He advised
her to engage the omniscient cabman. The Rue
Maugrabine was infinitely distant, on the other side
of the river. Félise suggested that a cab would cost
enormously. In Brantôme legends were still current
of scandalous exactions levied by Paris cabmen on provincials.
The driver twisted his head affably and
hoarsely murmured that it would not cost a fortune.
Perhaps two francs, two francs fifty, with a little
<span class='it'>pourboire</span>. He did not know. The amount would be
registered. The sergent de ville pointed out the taximeter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be not afraid, Mademoiselle. Enter. What number?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Number 29.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened the door of the stuffy little brougham.
Félise held out her hand as she would have held it out
to Père Chavrol, and thanked him as though he had
preserved her from legions of dragons. The last she
saw of him as she drove off was in the act of majestically
sweeping back a group of idlers who had halted
to witness the touching farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old cab jolted and swerved through blazing
vistas of unimagined thoroughfares; over bridges spanning
mysterious stretches of dark waters and connecting
looming masses of gigantic buildings; and through
more streets garish with light and apparent revelry.
Realisation of its glory came with a little sob of joy.
She was in Paris, the Wonderland of Paris transcending
all her dreams. Brantôme and Chartres seemed
afar off. She had the sensation of a butterfly escaping
from the chrysalis. She had been a butterfly for ages.
What unremembered kind of state had been her grub
condition? Thrills of excitement swept her little body.
She was throbbingly happy. And at the end of the
magic journey she would meet her father, marvel
among men, and her mother, the strange, sweet, mystical
being, the enchanted princess of her childish
visions, the warm, spiritual, all understanding, all
embracing woman of her maiden longings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The streets grew narrower, less important. They
were passing through the poor neighbourhood east
of the Place de la Bastille. Fairyland suffered a sinister
touch. Slight fears again assailed her. Some
of the streets appeared dark and suspect. Evil-looking
folk haunted the pavements. She wondered, with a
catch of the breath, whither she was being driven.
At last the cab swung into a street, darker, more suspect,
more ill-odoured than any, and stopped before a
large open doorway. She peered through the window.
Above the door she could just discern the white figures
“29” on the blue plaque. Her rosy dreams melted
into night, her heart sank. She alighted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is really 29 Rue Maugrabine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bien sûr, mademoiselle.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had forgotten to look at the taximeter, but taking
three francs from her purse, she asked the driver
if that was enough. He thanked her with raised hat
for munificence, and, whipping up his old horse, drove
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise entered a smelly little paved courtyard and
gazed about her helplessly. She had imagined such
another decent little house as her aunt’s, at which a
ring at the front door would ensure immediate admittance.
In this extraordinary dank well she felt more
lost than ever. Paris was a bewildering mystery. A
child emerged from some dark cavern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you tell me where Monsieur Fortinbras
lives?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child advised her to ask the concierge, and
pointed to the iron bell-pull. Félise rang. The frowsy
concierge gave the directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Au quatrième au coin, à gauche.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise entered the corner cavern and came on an
evil-smelling stone staircase, lit here and there by naked
gas-jets which blackened the walls at intervals. The
cold gathered round her heart. On the second landing
some noisy, ill-dressed men clattered past her and
caused her to shrink back with fear. She mounted the
interminable stairs. Here and there an open door
revealed a squalid interior. The rosy dream became
a nightmare. She had made some horrible blunder.
It was impossible that her father should live here.
But the concierge had confirmed the address. On the
fourth floor she paused; then, as directed, turned down
a small, ill-lit passage to the left. On a door facing her
at the end, she noticed the gleam of a card. She approached.
It bore the printed legend,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>“<span class='sc'>Daniel Fortinbras</span>,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:6em;'><span class='it'>Ancien Avoué de Londres,</span></p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:8em;'><span class='it'>Agent de Famille, &amp;c, &amp;c.</span>”</p>

<p class='noindent'>And written in pencil was the direction: “<span class='it'>Sonnez,
S. V. P.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight reassured and comforted her. Behind
this thin barrier dwelt those dearest to her on earth,
the dimly remembered saintly mother, the wise and
tender father. She forgot the squalor of the environment.
It was merely a feature of Paris mighty and
inscrutable, so different from Brantôme. She felt a
little throb of pride in her daring, in her achievement.
Without guidance—ungenerously she took no account
of the sergent de ville, the cabman and the concierge—she
had travelled from Chartres to this inmost heart
of Paris. She had accomplished her stupendous adventure.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The card invited her to ring. Above it
hung a bit of wood attached in the middle to a length
of twine. She pulled and an answering clang was
heard from within the apartment. Her whole being
vibrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment’s waiting, the door was flung open
by a coarse, red-faced, slatternly woman standing in a
poverty-stricken little vestibule. She looked at the
girl with curiously glazed eyes and slightly swayed
as she put up a hand to dishevelled hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Vous désirez?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Fortinbras,” gasped Félise, scared by the
abominable apparition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Fortinbras?” She mimicked the girl’s
clear accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oui, madame</span>,” replied Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon the woman withered her with a sudden
volley of drunken abuse. She knew how Fortinbras
occupied himself all day long. She did not complain.
But when the <span class='it'>gonzesses</span> of the <span class='it'>rive gauche</span> had the indecency
to come to his house, she would very soon put
them across her knee and teach them manners. This
is but a paraphrase of what fell upon Félise’s terror-stricken
ears. It fell like an avalanche; but it did not
last long, for suddenly came a voice well known but
pitched in an unfamiliar key of anger:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Qu’est-ce qu’il y a?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Fortinbras appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he caught sight of his daughter’s white face, he
clapped his hands to his head and reeled back, horror
in his eyes. Then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tais-toi!</span>” he thundered, and seizing the woman
masterfully by the arms, he pushed her into some inner
room, leaving Félise shaking on the threshold. In a
moment or two he re-appeared, caught overcoat and
old silk hat from a peg, and motioning Félise back,
marched out of his home and slammed the door behind
him. Father and daughter were now in the neutral
ground at the end of the dim, malodorous passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the name of God are you doing here,
Félise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to see my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fleshy, benign face of the man fell into the sags
of old age. His lower lip hung loose. His mild blue
eyes, lamping out from beneath noble brows, stared
agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Where is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew a deep breath. “Your mother—well—she
is in a nursing home, dear. No one, not even I, can see
her.” He took her by the arm and hurried her to the
staircase. “Come, come, dear, we must get away from
this. You understand. I did not tell you your mother
was so ill, for fear of making you unhappy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that dreadful woman, father?” she cried. And
the Alpine flower from which honey is made looked
like a poor little frost-bitten lily of the valley. She
faced him on the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That woman—that——” he waved an arm.
“That,” said he, quoting bitterly, “is a woman of no
importance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” cried Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With some of the elemental grossnesses of life she
was acquainted. You cannot manage a hotel in France
which is a free, non-Puritanical country, and remain
in imbecile ignorance. She was shocked to the depths
of her being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Fortinbras with outstretched hand.
But she shrank from him. “Come!” he commanded.
“There’s no time to lose. We must get out of
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are we going?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the Gare de Montparnasse. You must return
at once to Chartres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will never enter the house of Aunt Clothilde
again,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what has happened? My God! what has happened?”
he asked, as they hurried down the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breathlessly, brokenly, she told him. In the courtyard
he paused, put his hand to his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what can I do with you? My God! what can
I do with you in this dreadful city?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t there a hotel in Paris?” she asked, coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed in a mirthless way. “There are many.
There are the Ritz and the Meurice and the Elysée Palace.
Yes—there are hotels enough!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have plenty of money,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, my child,” said he. “Not an hotel. I
should go mad. I have an idea. Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had just reached the evil pavement of the Rue
Maugrabine, when Cécile Fortinbras, sister of the excellent
Gaspard Bigourdin and the pious Clothilde Robineau,
and mother of Félise, recovered from the stupor
to which the unprecedented fury of her husband had
reduced her, and reeled drunkenly to the flat door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Je vais arracher les yeux à cette putain-là!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started to tear the hussy’s eyes out; but by the
time she had accomplished the difficult descent and
had expounded her grievances to an unsympathetic
concierge, a motor omnibus was conveying father and
daughter silent and anguished to the other side of the
River Seine.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> huge door on the Boulevard Saint Germain
swung open at Fortinbras’s ring and admitted
them to a warm, marble-floored vestibule
adorned with rugs, palms and a cast or two of statuary.
Facing them, in its cage of handsome wrought iron-work,
stood the lift. All indicated a life so far apart
from that of the Rue Maugrabine that Félise, in spite
of the despair and disillusion that benumbed her soul,
uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who lives here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucilla Merriton, an American girl. Pray God
she is in,” replied Fortinbras, opening the lift gate.
“We can but see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pressed the second-floor button and the lift shot
up. On the landing were the same tokens of luxury.
A neat maid answered the door. Mademoiselle Merriton
was at home, but she had just begun dinner.
Fortinbras drew a card from a shabby pocketbook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Mademoiselle that the matter is urgent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maid retired, leaving them in a small lobby
beyond which was a hall lit by cunningly subdued
lights, and containing (to Félise’s unsophisticated vision)
a museum of costly and beautiful objects. Strange
skins of beasts lay on the polished floor, old Spanish
chests in glowing crimson girt with steel, queer chairs
with straight, tall backs, such as she had seen in the
sacristies of old churches in the Dordogne, and richly
carved tables were ranged against the walls, and above
them hung paintings of old masters, such as she was
wont to call “holy pictures,” in gilt frames. From
the soft mystery of a corner gleamed a marble copy
of the Venus de’ Medici, which, from Félise’s point of
view, was not holy at all. Yet the sense of beauty
and comfort pervading the place, appealed to her
senses. She stood on the threshold looking round
wonderingly, when a door opened, and, in a sudden
shaft of light, appeared a tall, slim figure which advanced
with outstretched hand. Félise shrank behind
her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Fortinbras, what good wind has brought
you?” The lady spoke in a rich and somewhat lazy
contralto. “Excuse that celestial idiot of a Céleste for
leaving you standing here in the cold. Come right in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led the way into the hall, and then became aware
of Félise and flashed a glance of enquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my little daughter, Lucilla.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Not Félise?” she gave her both hands in a
graceful gesture. “I’m so glad to see you. I’ve heard
all about you from Corinna Hastings. I put her up
for the night on her way back to London, you know.
Now why”—still holding Félise’s hands—“have you
kept her from us all this time, Fortinbras? I don’t
like you at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paris,” said Fortinbras, “isn’t good for little girls
who live in the heart of France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely the heart of France is Paris!” cried
Lucilla Merriton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paris, my dear Lucilla,” replied Fortinbras gravely,
“may be the liver, the spleen, the pancreas—whatever
giblets you please of France; but it is not its heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucilla laughed; and when she laughed she had a
way of throwing up her head which accentuated the
graceful setting of her neck. Her thick brown hair
brushed back, ever so little suggestive of the Pompadour,
from her straight forehead, aided the unconscious
charm of the habit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We won’t argue the point. You’ve brought Félise
here because you want me to look after her. How did
I guess? My dear man, I’ve lived twenty-seven years
in this ingenuous universe. How babes unborn don’t
spot its transparent simplicity I never could imagine.
You haven’t dined.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” said Fortinbras, “but Félise hasn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall dine again. It’s the first time you have
condescended to visit me, and I exact the penalty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to the open door whence she had issued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Céleste!”—the maid appeared—“Monsieur and
Mademoiselle are dining with me and Mademoiselle is
staying the night. See she has all she wants. <span class='it'>Allez
vite.</span> Go, my dear, with Céleste, and be quick, for dinner’s
getting cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Félise, subdued by her charming masterfulness,
had retired in the wake of the maid, Miss
Merriton turned on Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few words he told her what was meet for a
stranger to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she ran away and came to you for protection
and you can’t put her up? Is that right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The perch of an old vulture like myself,” said he,
“is no fit place for my daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucilla nodded. “That’s all right. But, say—you
don’t approve of this mediæval sort of marriage business,
do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I retain my English views. I shall explain them
to my brother-in-law and forbid the alliance. Besides,
the excellent Bigourdin is the last man in the world
to force her into a distasteful marriage. Reassure
her on that point. She can go back to Brantôme with
a quiet mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you remain in Paris with a mind equally
serene?” Lucilla asked, her deep grey eyes examining
his face, which he had vainly endeavoured to compose
into its habitual aspect of detached benevolence. He
met her glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The derelict,” said he, “is a thing of no account.
But it is better that it should not lie in the course of
the young and living ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucilla put her hands behind her back and sat on
the corner of an old Venetian table. And she still
looked at him, profoundly interested. Here was a
Fortinbras she had never met before, a broken man,
far removed from the shrewd and unctuous <span class='it'>marchand
de bonheur</span> of the Latin Quarter with his rolling periods
and opportunist philosophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something behind all this,” she remarked.
“If I’m to be any good, I ought to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He recovered a little and smiled. “Your perspicacity
does credit to your country,” said he. “Also
to your sex. There is much behind it. An unbridgeable
gulf of human sorrow. Remember that, should
my little girl be led away—which I very much doubt—to
talk to you of most unhappy things. She only came
to the edge of the gulf half an hour ago. The marriage
matter is but a thistledown of care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I more or less see,” said Lucilla. “The vulture’s
perch overhangs the gulf. Right. Now what do you
want me to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just keep her until I can find a way to send her
back to Brantôme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucilla raised a hand, and reflected for a few seconds.
Then she said: “I’ll run her down there myself
in the car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is most kind of you,” replied Fortinbras, “but
Brantôme is not Versailles. It is nearly three hundred
miles away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well? What of that? I suppose I can commandeer
enough gasoline in France to take me three hundred
miles. Besides, I am due the end of next week,
anyway, to stay with some friends at Cap Martin, before
going to Egypt. I’ll start a day or two earlier
and drop Félise on my way. Will that suit you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, again, Brantôme is not on your direct route
to Monte Carlo,” he objected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slid to her feet and laughed. “Do you want
me to be a young mother to your little girl, or don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then don’t conjure up lions in the path. See here,”
she touched his sleeve. “You were a good friend to
me once when I had that poor little fool Effie James
on my hands—I shouldn’t have pulled her through
without you—and you wouldn’t accept more than your
ridiculous fee—and now I’ve got a chance of shewing
you how much I appreciate what you did. I don’t
know what the trouble is, and now I don’t want to
know. But you’re my friend, and so is your daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras smiled sadly. “It is you that are the
<span class='it'>marchand de bonheur</span>. You remove an awful load
from my mind.” He took his old silk hat from the
console where he had deposited it, and held out his
hand. “The old vulture won’t stop to dinner. He
must be flying. Give my love, my devoted love to
Félise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with an abruptness which she could not reconcile
with his usual suave formality of manner, he
turned swiftly and walked through the lobby and disappeared.
His leave-taking almost resembled the flight
he spoke of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wealthy, comely, even-balanced American girl
looked blankly at the flat door and wondered, conscious
of tragedy. What was the gulf of which he spoke?
She knew little about the man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two years before
a girl from Cheyenne, Wyoming, who had brought
her letters of introduction, came to terrible grief.
There was blackmail at her throat. Somebody suggested
Fortinbras as counsellor. She, Lucilla, consulted
him. He succeeded in sending a damsel foolish,
reprehensible and frightened, but intact in reputation
and pocket, back to her friends in Cheyenne. His
fees for so doing amounted to twenty francs. For
two years therefore, she had passed the time of day
friendliwise with Fortinbras whenever she met him;
but until her fellow-student, Corinna Hastings, sought
her hospitality on the way back to England, and told
her of Brantôme and Félise, she had regarded him
merely as one of the strange, sweet monsters, devoid of
domestic attributes, even of a private life, that Paris,
city of portents and prodigies, had a monopoly in producing.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And now she had come upon just a
flabby, elderly man, piteously anxious to avert some
sordid misery from his own flesh and blood. She
sighed, turned and saw Félise in charge of Céleste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, you must be famished.” She put her arm
round the girl’s waist and led her into the dining-room.
“Your father couldn’t stay. But he told me
to give you his love and to regard myself as a sort of
young mother to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise murmured a shy acknowledgement. She was
too much dazed for coherent thoughts or speech. The
discovery of the conditions in which her father lived,
and the sudden withering of her faith in him, had
almost immediately been followed by her transference
into this warm wonder-house of luxury owned and
ruled by this queenly young woman, so exquisite in
her simple marvel of a dress. The soft lights, the
pictures, the elusive reflections from polished wood,
the gleam of heavy silver and cut glass, the bowl of
orchids on the table, the delicate napery—she had
never dreamed of such though she held herself to be
a judge of table-linen—the hundred adjuncts of a
wealthy woman’s dining room, all filled her with a
sense of the unreal, and at the same time raised her
poor fallen father in her estimation by investing him
with the character of a magician. Dainty food was
placed before her, but she could scarcely eat. Lucilla,
to put her more at her ease, talked of Corinna and of
Brantôme which she was dying to visit and of the
quaint Englishman, she had forgotten his name, who
had become a waiter. How was he getting on?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Martin? Very well, thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put down the glass of wine which she was about
to raise to her lips. For nearly an hour she had not
thought of Martin. She felt sundered from him by
many seas and continents. Since seeing him through
what scorching adventures had she not passed? She
had changed. The world had changed. Nothing
would ever be the same again. Tears came into her
eyes. Lucilla, observing them, smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like Monsieur Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody likes him; he is so gentle,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is that what women look for in a man?” asked
Lucilla. “Doesn’t she want some one strong to lean
on? Something to appeal to the imagination? Something
more <span class='it'>panache</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise thought of Lucien Viriot and his cavalry
plume and shivered. No. She did not want <span class='it'>panache</span>.
Martin’s quiet, simple ways, she knew not why, were
worth all the clanking of all the sabres in the world
put together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That depends on temperament, mademoiselle,”
said Félise, in French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucilla laughingly exclaimed: “You dear little
mouse. I suppose a tom-cat frightens you to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Félise was only listening with her outer ears. “I
am very fond of cats,” she replied simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon Lucilla laughed again with quick understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a half-grown Persian kitten,” she said,
“rather a beauty. Céleste, <span class='it'>apportez-moi le shah de
Perse</span>. That’s my little joke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est un calembour</span>,” said Félise, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it is. It’s real smart of you to see it. I
call him Padishah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Céleste brought a grey woolly mass of felinity
from a basket in a dim corner and handed it to Félise.
The beast purred and stretched contentedly in
her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a dear!” she cried. “What a fluffy little
dear! For the last week or two,” she found herself
saying, “my only friend has been a cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of a cat?” asked Lucilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not one like this. It was a thin old tabby.”
And under the influence of the soft baby thing on her
bosom and the kind eyes of her young hostess, the shyness
melted from her, and she told of Mimi, and Aunt
Clothilde, and the abhorred cathedral and the terrors
of her flight to Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had come, more or less, to an end, when Céleste
brought in a Pekinese spaniel, and set him down on
the hearthrug to a plate of minced raw beef, which
he proceeded to devour with lightning gluttony. Having
licked the polished plate from hearthrug to clattering
parquet and licked it underneath in the hope of
a grain of nourishment having melted through, he
arched his tail above his back and composing his miniature
leonine features, regarded his mistress with his
soul in his eyes, as who should say: “Now, having
tasted, when shall I truly dine?” But Lucilla sent him
to his chair, where he assumed an attitude of polite
surprise; and she explained to Félise, captivated by his
doggy winsomeness, that she called him “Gaby,” which
was short for Heliogabalus, the voluptuary; which
allusion Félise, not being familiar with The Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire, did not understand.
But, when Lucilla, breaking through rules of discipline,
caught up the tawny little aristocrat and apostrophized
him as “the noseless blunder,” Félise laughed heartily,
thinking it very funny, and, holding the kitten in her
left arm, took him from Lucilla with her right, and
covered the tiny hedonist with caresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the meal was over, Lucilla took her, still
embracing kitten and dog, into the studio—the wealthy
feminine amateur’s studio—a room with polished floors
and costly rugs and divans and tapestries and an easel
or two and a great wood fire blazing up an imitation
Renaissance chimney-piece. And Lucilla talked not
only as though she had known Félise all her life, but as
though Félise was the most fascinating little girl she
had ever met. And it was all more Wonderland for
Félise. And so it continued during the short evening;
for Lucilla, seeing that she was tired, ordered the removal
to their respective padded baskets of dog and
cat, both of which Félise had retained in her embrace,
and sent her to bed early; and it continued during the
process of undressing amid the beautiful trifles wherewith
she performed her toilette; and after she had
put on the filmy, gossamer garment adorned with embroidered
miracles that Céleste had laid out for her;
and after she had sunk asleep in the fragrant linen of
the warm nest. But in the middle of the night she
awoke and saw the face of the dreadful woman in the
Rue Maugrabine and heard the voice of her Aunt
Clothilde speaking blasphemy against her father, and
then she upbraided herself for being led away by the
enchantment of the Wonder-house, and breaking
down, sobbed for her lost illusions until the dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile a heart-broken man sat in a sordid
room toiling dully at the task of translating French
commercial papers into English, by which means he
added a little to his precarious income, while on the
other side of the partition his wife slept drunkenly.
That had been his domestic life, good God! he reflected,
for more years than he cared to number. But
up to then Félise had been kept in ignorance. Now the
veil had been lifted. She had, indeed, retained the
mother of her dreams, but at what a cost to him!
Would it not have been better to tell her the truth?
He stared at the type-written words until they were
hidden by a mist of tears. He had lost all that made
life sweet for him—the love of Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed his head in his hands. Judgment had
at last descended on him for the sins of his youth; for
he had erred grievously. All the misery he had endured
since then had been but a preparation for the
blow that had now fallen. It would be easy to go to her
to-morrow and say: “I deceived you last night. The
woman you saw was your mother.” But he knew he
would never be able to say it. He must pay the great
penalty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paid it the next day when he called humbly to
see her. She received him dutifully and gave him her
cheek to kiss, but he felt her shrink from him and read
the anguished condemnation in her eyes. He saw, too,
for he was quick at such things, how her glance
took in, for the first time in her life, his worn black
clothes, his frayed linen, his genteel shabbiness, a grotesque
contrast to the air of wealth in which she found
herself. And he knew that she had no mean thoughts
but was pierced to the heart by the discovery; for she
turned her head aside and bit her lip, so that he should
not guess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to tell you what I have done,” said
he, after some desultory and embarrassed talk about
Lucilla. “I have telegraphed to Chartres and Brantôme
to say that you are safe and sound, and I have
written to your Uncle Gaspard about Lucien Viriot.
You will never hear of the matter again, unless your
Aunt Clothilde goes to Brantôme, which I very much
doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, father,” said Félise, and the commonplace
words sounded cold in her ears. She was delivered,
she knew, from the nightmare of the past
few weeks; but she found little joy in her freedom.
Then she asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you told Uncle Gaspard why I ran away
from Aunt Clothilde?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough, dear, for him to understand. He will
ask you no questions, so you needn’t tell him anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t that be ungrateful? I have treated him
ungratefully enough already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras stretched out his hand to lay it caressingly
on her head, as he had done all her life, but,
remembering, withdrew it, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your uncle is the best and truest man I have ever
met,” said he. “And he loves you dearly and you love
him—and with love ingratitude can’t exist. Tell him
whatever you find in your heart. But there is one
thing you need never tell him—what you saw in the
Rue Maugrabine last night. I have done so already.
In this way there will be nothing secret between you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat with tense young face, looking at her hands.
Again she saw the squalid virago. She would see her
till her dying day. To no one on earth could she
speak of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras rose, kissed her on the forehead and went
forth to his day’s work of dealing out happiness to
a clamouring world.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>L</span><span class='sc'>UCILLA MERRITON</span> had much money, a kind
heart and a pretty little talent in painting. The
last secured her admittance to the circle of art-students
round about the Rue Bonaparte, the second
made her popular among them and the money enabled
her to obey any reasonable dictate of the kind heart
aforesaid. When those who were her intimates,
mainly hard-working and none too opulent English
girls, took her to task for her luxurious way of living,
and pointed out that it was not in keeping with
the Spartan, makeshift traditions of the Latin Quarter,
and that it differentiated her too much from her fellows,
she replied, with the frankness of her country,
first, that she saw no sense in pretending to be
other than she was, second, that in the atmosphere of
luxury to which she had been born, she was herself,
for whatever that self was worth; and thirdly, that
any masquerading as a liver of the simple life would
choke all the agreeable qualities out of her. When,
looking round her amateur studio, they objected that
she did not take her art seriously, she cordially agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take what you call my art,” she would say, “just
as it suits me. I can command too many things in the
world for me to sacrifice them to the mediocre result
I can get out of a paint-brush and a bit of canvas. I
shall never need paint for money, and if I did I’m sure
I shouldn’t earn any. But I love painting for its own
sake, and I have enough talent to make it worth while
to have good instruction in technique, so that my
pictures shall more or less satisfy myself and not
set my friends’ teeth on edge. And that’s why I’m
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a wealthy vagabond of independent fortune
inherited from her mother long since deceased,
with no living ties save her father, a railway director
in America, now married to a young wife, a school-mate
of her own, whom, since her childhood, she had
peculiarly abhorred. But in the world, which lay
wide open to her, <span class='it'>videlicet</span> the civilised nations of the
two hemispheres, she had innumerable friends. No
human will pretended to control her actions. She
was as free to live in Rosario as in Buda-Pesth; in
Nairobi as in Nijni Novgorod. For the last two or
three years she had elected to establish her headquarters
in Paris and study painting. But why the latter
process should involve a hard bed in a shabby room
and dreadful meals at the Petit Cornichon, she could
never understand. Occasionally, on days of stress at
the <span class='it'>atélier</span>, she did lunch at the Petit Cornichon. It
was convenient, and, as she was young and thirsty for
real draughts of life, the chatter and hubbub of insensate
ambitions afforded her both interest and amusement;
but she found the food execrable and the universal
custom of cleaning knife, fork, spoon and plate
before using them exceedingly disgusting. Yet, being
a lady born and bred, she performed the objectionable
rite in the most gracious way in the world; and when
it came to comradeship, then her democratic traditions
asserted themselves. Her student friends ranged the
social gamut. If the wearer were a living spirit, she
regarded broken boots and threadbare garments merely
as an immaterial accident of fortune, like a broken
nose or an amputated limb. The flat on the Boulevard
St. Germain was the haven of many a hungry girl and
boy. And they found their way thither (as far as
Lucilla was concerned) not because they were hungry,
but because that which lay deep in their souls had won
her accurate recognition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By way of digression, an essential difference in
point of view between English and Americans may
here be noted. If an Englishman has reason to admire
a tinker and make friends with him, he will leave
his own respectable sphere and enter that of the tinker,
and, in some humble haunt of tinkerdom, where he can
remain incognito, will commune with his crony over
pots of abominable and digestion-racking ale. The
instinct of the American, in sworn brotherhood with
a tinker, is, on the other hand, to lift the tinker to
his own habitation of delight. He will desire to take
him into a saloon which he himself frequents, fill him
up with champagne and provide him with the best,
biggest and strongest cigar that money can buy. In
both cases appear the special defects of national qualities.
The Englishman goes to the tinker’s boozing ken
(thereby, incidentally, putting the tinker at his ease)
because he would be ashamed of being seen by any
of his own clan in a tinker’s company. The American
does not care a hang for being seen with the
tinker; he wants to give his friend a good time; but,
incidentally, he has no intuitive regard for the tinker’s
feelings, predilections and timidities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From which disquisition it may be understood how
Lucilla played Lady Bountiful without the slightest
consciousness of doing so. She played it so well, with
regard to Félise, as to make that young woman in
the course of a day or two her slave and worshipper.
She shewed her the sights of Paris, Versailles, the
Galeries de Lafayette, the Tomb of Napoleon, Poiret’s,
the Salon d’Hiver, the Panthéon and Cartier’s in the
Rue de la Paix. With the aid of pins and scissors
and Céleste, she also attired her in an evening frock
and under the nominal protection of an agreeable
young compatriot from the Embassy took her to dine
at the Café de Paris and then to the Théâtre du Gymnase.
A great, soft-cushioned, smooth, noiseless car
carried them luxuriously through the infinite streets;
and when they were at home it seemed to await them
night and day by the kerb of the Boulevard Saint
Germain. Lucilla set the head of the little country
mouse awhirl with sensations. Félise revered her as
a goddess, and whispered in awe the Christian name
which she was commanded to use.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A breathless damsel, with a jumble of conflicting
scraps of terror and delight instead of a mind, her
arms full of an adored Persian kitten and an adoring
Pekinese spaniel, after a couple of days’ flashing course
through France, was brought in the gathering dusk,
with a triumphant sweep up the hill, to the familiar
front door of the Hôtel des Grottes. Baptiste, green-aproned,
gaped as he saw her, and, scuttling indoors,
shouted at the top of his voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Monsieur, monsieur, c’est mademoiselle!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant, Bigourdin lumbered out at full speed.
He almost lifted her from the car, scattering outraged
kitten and offended dog, hid her in his vast
embrace and hugged her and kissed her and held her
out at arm’s length and laughed and hugged her
again. There was no doubt of the prodigal’s welcome.
She laughed and sobbed and hugged the great man
in return. And then he recovered himself and became
the <span class='it'>bon hôtelier</span> and assisted Lucilla to alight, while
Félise greeted a smiling Martin and suffered the embrace
of Euphémie, panting from the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If mademoiselle will give herself the trouble of
following me——” said Bigourdin, and led the way
up the stairs, followed by Lucilla and Céleste, guardian
of the jewel case. He threw open the door of the
<span class='it'>chambre d’honneur</span>, a double-windowed room, above
the terrace, overlooking the town and the distant
mountains of the Limousin, and shewed her with pride
a tiny salon adjoining, the only private sitting-room
in the hotel, crossed the corridor and flung to view
the famous bathroom, disclosed next door a room for
the maid, and swept her back to the bedroom, where
a pine-cone fire was blazing fragrantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Voilà, mademoiselle</span>,” said he. “<span class='it'>Tout à votre disposition.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it is absolutely charming,” cried Lucilla.
She looked round. “Oh! what lovely things you
have!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin beamed and made a little bow. He took
inordinate pride in his <span class='it'>chambre d’honneur</span> in which
he had stored the gems of the Empire furniture acquired
by his great-grandfather, the luckless Général
de Brigade. The instantaneous appreciation of a casual
glance enchanted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope, mademoiselle,” said he, in his courteous
way, “you will do Félise and myself the honour of
being our guest as long as you deign to stay at Brantôme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucilla met his bright eyes. “That’s delightful of
you,” she laughed. “But I’m not one solitary person,
I’m a caravan. There’s me and the maid and the
chauffeur and the car and the dog and the cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hotel is very little, mademoiselle,” replied Bigourdin,
“but our hearts are big enough to entertain
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing more, or, at least, nothing more by way
of protest, was to be said. Lucilla put out her hand
in her free, generous gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Bigourdin, I accept with pleasure your
delightful hospitality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Je vous remercie infiniment, mademoiselle</span>,” said
Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went downstairs in a flutter of excitement. Not
for four generations, so far as he was aware, had
such an event occurred in the Hôtel des Grottes. Members
of the family, of course, had stayed there without
charge. Once, towards the end of the Second Empire,
a Minister of the Interior had occupied the
<span class='it'>chambre d’honneur</span>, and had gone away without paying
his bill; but that remained a bad black debt in the
books of the hotel. Never had a stranger been an
honoured guest. He had offered the position, it is
true, to Corinna; but then he was in love with Corinna,
which makes all the difference. The French are
not instinctively hospitable; when they are seized, however,
by the impulse of hospitality, all that they have
is yours, down to the last crust in the larder; but they
are fully conscious of their own generosity, they feel
the tremendousness of the spiritual wave. So Bigourdin,
kindest-hearted of men, lumbered downstairs
aglow with a sense of altruistic adventure. In the
vestibule he met Félise who had lingered there in order
to obtain from Martin a <span class='it'>compte rendu</span> of the household
and the neighbourhood. Things had gone none
too well—Monsieur Peyrian, one of their regular commercial
travellers, having discovered a black-beetle in
his bread, had gone to the Hôtel du Cygne. The
baker had indignantly repudiated the black-beetle, his
own black-beetles being apparently of an entirely different
species. Another baker had been appointed,
whose only defect was his inability to bake bread.
The <span class='it'>brave</span> Madame Thuillier, who had been called in
to superintend the factory, had quarrelled, after two
days, with everybody, and had gone off in dudgeon
because she did not eat at the <span class='it'>patron’s</span> table. Then
they had lost two of their best hands, one a young married
woman who was reluctantly compelled to add to
the population of France, and the other a girl who
was discharged for laying false information against
the very respectable and much married Baptiste, saying
that he had pinched her. The old Mère Maquoise,
<span class='it'>marchande de quatre saisons</span>, who was reputed to have
known Général Bigourdin, was dead, and one of the
hotel omnibus horses had come down on its knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise, forgetful of the Maison de Blanc and Nôtre
Dame, wrung her hands. She had descended from
fairyland into life’s dear and important realities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s desolating, what you tell me,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all because you went away and left us,” said
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is not going to leave us again!” cried Bigourdin,
swooping down on her and carrying her off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the prim little salon he hugged her again and
said gripping her hands:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It appears you have greatly suffered, my poor little
Félise. But why didn’t you tell me from the first that
you were unhappy with your Aunt Clothilde? I did
not know she had turned into such a <span class='it'>vieille pimbèche</span>.
She has written. And I have answered. Ah! I tell
you, I have answered! You need never again have
any fear of your Aunt Clothilde. I hope I am a Christian.
But I hope too that I shall always differ from
her in my ideas of Christianity. <span class='it'>Mais tout ça est fini—bel
et bien fini.</span> We have to talk of ourselves. I have
been a miserable man since you have been
away, <span class='it'>ma petite</span> Félise. I tell you that in all
frankness. Everything has been at sixes and sevens.
I can’t do without my little <span class='it'>ménagère</span>. And you shall
never marry anybody, even the President of the Republic,
unless you want to. <span class='it'>Foi de Bigourdin! Voilà!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise cried a little. “<span class='it'>Tu es trop bon pour moi, mon
oncle.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Allons donc!</span> I seem to have been an old bear.
Yet, in truth, I am harmless as a sheep. But have
confidence in me, and in my very dear friend, your
father—there are many things you cannot understand—and
things will arrange themselves quite happily.
You love me just a little bit, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flung her arms round the huge man’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Je t’adore, mon petit oncle</span>,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes afterwards, with bunch of keys slung
at her waist, she was busy restoring to order the
chaos of the interregnum. Terrible things had happened
during the absence of the feminine eye. Even
Martin shared the universal reprimand. For Félise,
manageress of hotel, and Félise, storm-tossed little
human soul, were two entirely different entities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Martin, how could you and my uncle pass
these napkins from that infamous old thief of a
laundress. They are black!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And ruthlessly she flicked a napkin folded mitre-wise
from the centre table before the eyes of the folder
and revealed its dingy turpitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well that I am back,” she declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is indeed, Mademoiselle Félise,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a swift little glance out of the tail of
her eye, before she sped away, and the corners of her
lips drooped as though in disappointment. Then perhaps
reflecting that she had been addressing the waiter
and not the man, her face cleared. At all events he
had taken her rating in good part.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner had already begun and the hungry commercials,
napkins at neck, were finishing their soup lustily,
when Lucilla entered the dining room. The open
Medici collar to a grey velvet dress shewed the graceful
setting of her neck and harmonised with the brown
hair brushed up from the forehead. She advanced
smiling and stately, giving the impression of the perfect
product of a new civilisation. Martin, who had
but seen her for a few seconds in the dusk confusedly
clad in furs, stood spell-bound, a pile of used soup-plates
in his hands. Never had so radiant an apparition
swum before his gaze. Bigourdin, dining as
usual with Félise, rose immediately and conducted his
guest to the little table by the terrace where once Martin
and Corinna had sat. It was specially adorned
with tawny chrysanthemums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fell dreaming before the fire in the midst of your
wonderful, old-world things, and had to hurry into
my clothes, and so I’m late,” she apologised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only you found all you needed, mademoiselle——”
said Bigourdin anxiously. “It is the provinces
and not Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She assured him that Félise had seen to every conceivable
want and he left her to her meal. Martin
delivered his soup-plates into the arms of the chambermaid
and hovered over Lucilla with the menu card.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will mademoiselle take the dinner?” he asked in
French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She regarded him calmly and humorously and
nodded. He became aware that her eyes were of a
deep, deep grey, full of light. He found it difficult
not to keep on looking at them. Breaking away,
however, he fetched her soup and went off to attend
to the others. At every pause by her table he noted
some new and incomparable attribute. When bending
over the platter from which she helped herself, he
saw that her hands were beautifully shaped, plump,
with long thin fingers and with delicate markings of
veins beneath the white skin. An upward glance
caught more blue veins on the temples. Another time
he was struck by the supple grace of her movements.
There were infinite gleams in her splendid hair. The
faintest suggestion of perfume arose from her garments.
She declined the vegetable course and, declining,
looked up at him and smiled. He thought he had
never seen a brow so noble, a nose so exquisitely cut,
lips so kind and mocking. Her face was that of a
Romney duchess into which the thought and spiritual
freedom of the twentieth century had entered. As he
sped about the service, thrusting dishes beneath bearded
or blue, ill-shaven chins, her face floated before his
eyes; every now and then he stole a distant glance at
it, and longed for the happy though transient moment
when he should come close to it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was clearing her table for dessert she
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you speak French to me, when you know
I’m an American?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the custom of the house when a guest speaks
such excellent French as mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very kind of you,” she said in English;
“but it seems rather ridiculous for an American and
an Englishman to converse in a foreign language.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know I am English, mademoiselle?”
he asked, his heart a-flutter at the unexpected interchange
of words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “I have eyes. Besides, I know all
about you—first from our friend Corinna Hastings,
and lately from my little hostess over the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flushed, charmed by the deep music of her voice
and delighted at being recognised by her not only as
an individual (for she radiated an attraction which
had caused him to hate the conventional impersonality
of waiterdom) but as a member more or less of
her own social class. He paused, plate of crumbs in
one hand and napkin in the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know Corinna Hastings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evidently. How else could she have told me of
your romantic doings?” she replied laughingly, and
Martin flushed deeper, conscious of an idiot question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set the apples and little white grapes before her.
“I ought to have asked you,” said he, “how Miss Hastings
came to talk to you about me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She came on the train from Brantôme and rang
my bell in Paris. She kept me up talking till four
o’clock in the morning—not of you all the time. Don’t
imagine it. You were just interestingly incidental.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Garçon</span>,” cried a voice from the centre table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bien, m’sieur.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin tucked his napkin under his arm and turned
away, followed by Lucilla’s humorous glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>L’addition!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bien, m’sieur.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He became the perfect waiter again, and brought the
bill to the commercial traveller who had merely come
in for dinner. The latter paid in even money, rose
noisily—he was a stout, important, red-faced man—and,
fumbling in several pockets rendered difficult of
access by adiposity and good cheer, at last produced
four coppers which he deposited with a base, metallic
chink in Martin’s palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Merci, m’sieur. Bon soir, m’sieur</span>,” said the perfect
waiter. But he would have given much to be able
to dispose of the horrible coins otherwise than by
thrusting them in his trouser pocket, to be able, for
instance, to hurl them at the triple sausage neck of the
departing donor; for he knew the starry, humorous
eyes of the divinity were fixed on him. He felt hot
and clammy and did not dare look round. And the
hideous thought flashed through his mind: “Will she
offer me a tip when she leaves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He busied himself furiously with his service, and,
in a few moments, was relieved to see her ceremoniously
conducted by Bigourdin and Félise from the
<span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>. On the threshold Bigourdin paused
and called him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will serve coffee and liqueurs in the <span class='it'>petit
salon</span>, and if you go to the Café de l’Univers, you will
kindly make my excuses to our friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To enter the primly and plushily furnished salon,
bearing the tray, and to set out the cups and glasses
and bottles was an ordeal which he went through with
the automatic rigidity of a highly trained London footman,
looking neither to right nor left. He had a vague
impression of a queenly figure reclining comfortably in
an arm chair, haloed by a little cloud of cigarette
smoke. He retired, finished his work in the pantry,
swallowed a little food, changed his things and went
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instinct led him along the quays and through the
narrow, old-world streets to the patch of yellow light
before the Café de l’Univers. But there he halted,
suddenly disinclined to enter. Something new and
amazing had come into his life—he could not yet tell
what—discordant with the commonplace of the familiar
company. He looked through the space left between
the edge of the blind and the jamb of the window
and saw Beuzot, the professor at the Ecole Normale,
playing backgammon with Monsieur Callot, the
postmaster; and a couple of places away from them
was visible the square-headed old Monsieur Viriot,
smiting his left palm with his right fist. The excellent
old man always did that when he inveighed against
the government. To-night Martin cared little about
the Government of the French Republic; still less for
backgammon. He had a nostalgia for unknown things
and an absurd impulse to walk abroad to find them
beneath the moon and stars. Obeying the impulse, he
retraced his steps along the quays and struck the
main-road past the habitations of the rock dwellers.
He walked for a couple of miles between rocks casting
jagged shadows and a calm, misty plain without finding
anything, until, following a laborious, zig-zag
course, a dissolute quarryman of his acquaintance in
incapable charge of a girl child of five, lurched into
him and laid the clutch of a drowning mariner upon
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Martin,” said he. “It is the good God
who has sent you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boucabeille,” said Martin—for that was the name
of the miscreant—“you ought to be ashamed of yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not tell me, Monsieur Martin,” replied
Boucabeille.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the child was crying bitterly and the father was
self-reproachful—he had taken the <span class='it'>mioche</span> to see her
aunt, and coming back had met some friends who had
enticed him into the Café of the Mère Diridieu, where
they had given him some poisoned, leg-dislocating alcohol—Martin
took the child in his arms, and trudged
back to the rock-dwellings where the drunkard lived.
On the way Boucabeille, relieved of paternal responsibility,
the tired child now snuggling sleepily and comfortably
against Martin’s neck, grew confidential and
confessed, with sly enjoyment, that he had already
well watered his throttle before he started. The man,
he declared, with the luminousness of an apostle, who
did not get drunk occasionally was an imbecile denying
himself the pleasures of the Other Life. Martin
recognised in Boucabeille a transcendentalist, no matter
how muddle-headed. The sober clod did not know
adventures. He did not know happiness. The path
of the drunkard, Boucabeille explained, was strewn
with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anxious wife who met them at the door called
Martin a saint from heaven and her husband a stream
of unmentionable things. He staggered under the
outburst and laid his hand again on Martin’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Martin, I have committed a fault. I take
you to witness”—his wife paused in her invective to
hear the penitent—“if I was more drunk I wouldn’t
pay attention to anything she says. I have committed
a fault. I haven’t got drunk enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sale cochon!</span>” cried the lady, and Martin left them,
meditating on the philosophy of drunkenness. <span class='it'>Quo
me rapis Bacche, plenum tui?</span> To what godlike adventure?
But the magic word was <span class='it'>plenum</span>—right full
to the lips. No half-and-half measures for Bacchus.
Apparently Boucabeille had failed in his adventure and
had missed happiness by a gill. Browning’s lines about
the little more and the little less came into his head,
and he laughed. Both the poet and the muddle-headed
quarryman were right. Adventures not brought
through to the end must be dismal fiasco.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His
mind wandered a little. His shoulder was ever such a
trifle stiff from carrying the child; but he missed the
warmth of her grateful little body, and the trusting
clasp of her tiny arms. It had been an insignificant
adventure, an adventure, so to speak, in miniature;
but it had been complete, rounded off, perfect. The
proof lay in the glow of satisfaction at the thing accomplished.
Materially, there was nothing to complain
about. But from a philosophic standpoint the satisfaction
was not absolute. For the absolute is finality,
and there is no finality in mundane things. From a
thing so finite as human joy eternal law decreed the
evolution of the germs of fresh desires. There had
been a strange sweetness in the clasp of those tiny
arms. How much sweeter to a man would be the
clasp, if the arms were his own flesh and blood? Martin
was shocked by the suspicion that things were not
going right with him as a human being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pleasant mass of the Hôtel des Grottes looming
dimly white against its black background came into
view. The lights in an uncurtained and unshuttered
window, above the terrace, were visible. A figure
passed rapidly across the room and sent drunkards and
adventures and curly-headed five-year-olds packing
from his mind. But he averted his eyes and walked
on and came to the Pont de Dronne, and then halted
to light a cigarette. The frosty silence of sharp moonlight
hung over the town. The silver shimmer reflected
from reaches of water and from slated roofs
invested it with unspeakable beauty and peace. A little
cold caressing wind came from the distant mountains,
seen in soft outline. Near black shelves of rock
and dark mysteries of forest and masses of houses
beyond the bridge-end closed other horizons. He remembered
his first impression of Brantôme, when he
had sat with Corinna on the terrace, a mothering shelter
from all fierce and cruel things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” thought he, as he puffed his cigarette
smoke in the clear air, “beyond this little spot lies a
world of unceasing endeavour and throbbing pulses
and women of disturbing beauty. Such a woman on
her meteoric passage from one sphere of glory to another
has flashed before my eyes to-night. Why am
I here pursuing an avocation, which, though honest,
is none the less greasy and obscure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unable to solve the enigma, he sighed and threw his
cigarette, which had gone out during his meditation,
into the river. A patter of quick footsteps at the approach
of the bridge caused him to turn his head, and
he saw emerge from the gloom into the moonlight a
tall, fur-clad figure advancing towards him. She gave
him a swift look of recognition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Martin——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his cap. “Good evening, Miss Merriton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She halted. “My good host and hostess are gone
to bed. I couldn’t sit by my window and sentimentalise
through the glass; so I came out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a fine night,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is. But not one to hang about on a windy
bridge. Come for a little walk, if you have time, and
protect me against the dangers of Brantôme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Go for a walk with her? Defend her from dangers?
Verily he would go through the universe with
her! His heart thumped. It was in his whirling
brain to cry: “Come and ride with me throughout
the world and the more dragons I can meet and slay
in your service, the more worthy shall I be to kiss the
hem of your sacred grey velvet dinner-gown.” But
from his fundamental, sober, commonsense he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only dangers of Brantôme at this time of
night are prudish eyes and scandalous tongues.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew a little breath. “Thank you,” she said.
“That’s frank and sensible. I’m always forgetting
that France isn’t New York, or Paris for the matter
of that, where one can do as one likes. I don’t know
Provincial France a little bit, but I suppose, for red-hot
gossip, it isn’t far behind a pretty little New England
village. Still, can’t we get out of range, somehow,
of the eyes? That road over there”—she waved
a hand in the direction of the silent high-road, which
Martin had lately travelled—“doesn’t seem to be encumbered
with the scandal-mongers of Brantôme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “Will you try it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They set forth briskly. The glimpse into her nature
delighted him. She appreciated at once the motive
of his warning, but was serenely determined to
have her own way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were just beginning an interesting little talk
when you were called off,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin felt himself grow red, remembering the
tightly pocketed bagman who took the stage while
he searched for eleemosynary sous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My profession has its drawbacks,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So has every profession. I’ve got a friend in
America—I have met him two or three times—who is
conductor on the Twentieth Century Express between
New York and Chicago. He’s by way of being an
astronomer, and the great drawback of his profession
is that he has no time to sit on top of a mountain and
look at stars. The drawback of yours is that you can’t
carry on pleasant conversations whenever you like.
But the profession’s all right, unless you’re ashamed
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why should I be ashamed of it?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Why should you? My father, who
was the son of a New England parson——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father was a parson,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was he? Well, that’s good. We both come of a
God-fearing stock, which is something in these days.
Anyway, my father, in order to get through college,
waited on the men in Hall at Harvard, and was a
summer waiter at a hotel in the Adirondacks. Of
course there are some Americans who would like it to
be thought that their ancestors brought over the family
estates with them in the <span class='it'>Mayflower</span>. But we’re not like
that. Say,” she said, after a few steps through the
sweet keenness of the moonlit night. “Have you heard
lately from Corinna?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not. In her last letter to him she had announced
her departure from the constricting family
circle of Wendlebury. She was going to London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where she would have a chance of self-development,”
said Lucilla, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you know that?” Martin asked in simple
surprise, for those had been almost Corinna’s own
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else would she go to London for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Martin. “She did not tell
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did not discuss Corinna further. But Martin
felt that his companion had formulated his own
diagnosis of Corinna’s abiding defect: her suspicion
that the cosmic scheme centred round the evolution of
Corinna Hastings. In a very subtle way the divinity
had established implied understandings between them.
They were of much the same parentage. In her own
family the napkin had played no ignoble part. They
were at one in their little confidential estimate of their
common friend. And when she threw back her adorable
head and drew a deep breath and said: “It’s just
lovely here,” he felt deliciously near her. Deliciously
and dangerously. A little later, as they came upon
the rock dwellings, she laid a fleeting, but thrilling
touch on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the world are those houses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told her. He described the lives of the inhabitants.
He described, on the way back, for the rocks
marked the limit of their stroll, his adventure with
Boucabeille. Ordinarily shy, and if not tongue-tied,
at least unimaginative in speech, he now found vivid
words and picturesque images, his soul set upon repaying
her, in some manner for her gracious comradeship.
Her smiles, her interest, her quick sympathy,
the occasional brush of her furs against his body, as
she leaned to listen, intoxicated him. He spoke of
France, the land of his adoption, and the spiritual
France that no series of hazardous governments could
impair, with rhapsodical enthusiasm. She declared, in
her rich, deep voice, as though carried away by him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love to hear you say such things. It is splendid
to get to the soul of a people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her tone implied admiration of achievement. He
laughed rather foolishly, in besotted happiness. They
had reached the steep road leading to the Hôtel des
Grottes. She threw a hand to the moonlit bridge,
where they had met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you thinking of all that when I dragged you
off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed again. “No,” he confessed. “I was
wondering what on earth I was doing there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said she softly, “you have just given
me the <span class='it'>mot de l’enigme</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the vestibule they came across Bigourdin, cigarette
in mouth, sprawling as might have been expected,
on the cane-bottomed couch. He was always the last
to retire, a fact which the blissful Martin had forgotten.
Lucilla sailed up, radiant in her furs, the flush
of exercise on her cheeks visible even under the dim
electric light. Bigourdin raised his ponderous bulk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I found Monsieur Martin outside,” she said, “and
I commandeered him as an escort round the neighbourhood.
He couldn’t refuse. I hope I haven’t done
wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin knows more about Brantôme,” replied Bigourdin
courteously, “than most of the Brantômois
themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Céleste appeared from the gloom of the stairs. Lucilla,
after an idle word or two, retired. Bigourdin
closed and bolted the front door. To do that he would
trust nobody, not even Martin. Having completed the
operation, he advanced slowly towards his employé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you go to the café to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Martin. “I was walking with mademoiselle,
who, as she may have told you, is a friend
of Mademoiselle Corinna.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, she told me that,” said Bigourdin. “There
is no need of explanations, <span class='it'>mon ami</span>. But I am
glad you did not go to the café. I ought to have
warned you. We must be very discreet towards
the Viriots. There is no longer any marriage.
Félise doesn’t want it. Her father has formally forbidden
it. I have no desire to make anybody unhappy.
But there it is. <span class='it'>Foutu, le mariage.</span> And I haven’t said
anything as yet to the Viriots. And, again, I can’t
say anything to Monsieur Viriot, until he says something
to me. <span class='it'>Voilà la situation. Cest d’une délicatesse
extraordinaire.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed his hand over his head and tried to grip
the half-inch stubble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you this, <span class='it'>mon cher</span> Martin, because you know
the intimate affairs of the family. So”—he shook an
impressive finger—“act towards the Viriots, father
and son, as if you knew nothing, nothing at all. <span class='it'>Laissez-moi
faire.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin pledged the discretion of the statues in the
old Alhambra tale. What did the extraordinary delicacy
of the situation between Bigourdin and the Viriots
matter to him? When he reached his room, he
laughed aloud, oblivious of Bigourdin, the Viriots and
poor little Félise who (though he knew it not) lay
achingly awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last a woman, a splendid wonder of a woman, a
woman with the resplendent dignity of the King’s
daughter of the fairy tales, with the bewilderment of
beauty of face and of form and of voice like the cooing
of a dove, with the delicate warm sympathy of
sheer woman, had come into his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The usually methodical Martin threw his shirt and
trousers across the room and walked about like a
lunatic in his under things, until a sneeze brought
him to the consciousness of wintry cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only satisfying sanction of romance is its charm
of intimate commonplace.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HEY</span> had further talk together the next afternoon.
A lost remnant of golden autumn freakishly
returned to warm the December air. The
end of the terrace caught a flood of sunshine wherein
Lucilla, wrapped in furs and rugs and seated in one
of the bent-wood rocking-chairs brought out from winter
quarters for the occasion, had established herself
with a book. The little dog’s head appeared from
under the rug, his strange Mongolian eyes staring unsympathetically
at a draughty world. Martin sauntered
out to breathe the beauty of the hour, which
was that of his freedom. He explained the fact when
she informed him that Félise and Bigourdin had both
left her a few minutes before in order to return to
their duties. Martin being free, she commanded him
to stay and entertain her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were a good American,” she said, “I should
be racing about in the car doing the sights of the
neighbourhood; but to sit lazily in the sun is too great
a temptation. Besides,” she added, “I have explored
the town this morning. I went round with Monsieur
Bigourdin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is very proud of Brantôme,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dismissed Brantôme. “I have lost my heart to
him. He is so big and comfortable and honest, and he
talks history like a poetical professor with the manners
of an Embassy attaché. He’s unique among landlords.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love Bigourdin,” said Martin, “but the type is
not uncommon in these old inns of France—especially
those which have belonged to the same family for
generations. There is the proprietor of the Hôtel du
Commerce at Périgueux, for instance, who makes <span class='it'>pâté
de foie gras</span>, just like Bigourdin, and is a well-known
authority on the prehistoric antiquities of the Dordogne.
He once went to London, for a day; and what
do you think was his object? To inspect the collection
of flint instruments at the Guildhall Museum. He
told me so himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all very interesting,” said Lucilla, “but I’m
sure he’s nothing like Bigourdin. He can’t be. And
his hotel can’t be like this. It’s the queerest hotel I’ve
ever struck. It’s run by such unimaginable people. I
think I’ve lost my heart to all of you. There’s Bigourdin,
there’s Félise, the dearest and most delicate little
soul in the world, the daughter of a remarkable mystery
of a man, there are Baptiste and Euphémie and
Marie, the chambermaid, who seem to exude desire to
fold me to their bosoms whenever I meet them, and
there is yourself, an English University man, an exceedingly
competent waiter and a perfectly agreeable
companion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The divinity crowned with a little sealskin motoring
toque which left unhidden the fascination of her up-brushed
hair, cooed on deliciously. The knees of Martin,
leaning against the parapet, became as water. He
had a crazy desire to kneel at her feet on the concrete
floor of the terrace. Then he noticed that between
her feet and the cold concrete floor there was
no protecting footstool. He fetched one from the
dining room and had the felicity of placing it for her
and readjusting the rugs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’re not going to be a waiter here all
your life,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He signified that the hypothesis was correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in his awakened imagination to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow you to the ends of the earth,” but common
sense replied that he did not know. He had made
no plans. She suggested that he might travel about
the wide world. He breathed an inward sigh. Why
not the starry firmament? Why not, rainbow-winged
and golden spear in hand, swoop, a bright Archangel,
from planet to planet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to see Egypt,” she said, “and feel what
a speck of time you are when the centuries look down
on you. It’s wholesome. I’m going early in the New
Year. I go there and try to paint the desert; and
then I sit down and cry—which is wholesome too—for
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Martin’s inner vision floated a blurred picture
of camels and pyramids and sand and oleographic
sunsets. He said, infatuated: “I would give my soul
to go to Egypt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Egypt is well worth a soul,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Words and reply were driven from his head by the
sight of a great splotch of grease on the leg of his
trousers. A dress suit worn daily for two or three
months in pursuit of a waiter’s avocation, does not
look its best in stark sunlight. Self-conscious, he
crossed his legs, as he leaned against the parapet, in
order to hide the splotch. Then he noticed that one
of the studs of his shirt had escaped from the frayed
and blackened buttonhole. Again he felt her humorous
eyes upon him. For a few moments he dared
not meet them. When he did look up he found them
fixed caressingly on the Pekinese spaniel, which had
slipped upon its back in the hope of a rubbed stomach,
and was waving feathery paws in pursuit of her finger.
A moment’s reflection brought heart of grace.
Greasy suit and untidy stud-hole must have been obvious
to her from his first appearance on the terrace—indeed
they must have been obvious while he had
waited on her at déjeuner. Her invitation to converse
was proof that she disregarded outer trappings, that
she recognised the man beneath the soup-stained raiment.
He uncrossed his legs and stood upright. Then
he remembered her remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The question is,” said he, “whether my soul would
fetch enough to provide me with a ticket to Egypt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled lazily. The sunlight being full on her
face, he noticed that her eyelashes were brown. Wondrous
discovery!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow,” she replied, “where there’s a soul, there’s
a way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took a cigarette from a gold case that lay on
the little iron table beside her. Martin sprang forward
with a match. She thanked him graciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t money that does the real things,” she said,
after a few meditative puffs. “To hear an American
say so must sound strange to your English ears. You
believe, I know, that Americans make money an Almighty
God that can work any miracles over man and
natural forces that you please. But it isn’t so. The
miracles, such as they are, that America has performed,
have been due to the naked human soul. Money has
come as an accident or an accretion and has helped
things along. We have a saying which you may have
heard: ‘Money talks.’ That’s just it. It talks. But
the soul has had to act first. Money had nothing to
do with American Independence. It was the soul of
George Washington. It wasn’t money that invented
the phonograph. It was the soul of the train newsboy
Edison. It wasn’t money that brought into being the
original Cornelius Vanderbilt. It was the soul of the
old ferryman that divined the power of steam both
on sea and land a hundred years ago, and accidentally
or incidentally or logically or what you please,
founded the Vanderbilt fortune. I could go on for
ever with instances from my own country—instances
that every school-child knows. In the eyes of the
world the Almighty Dollar may seem to rule America
—but every thinking American knows in his heart of
hearts that the Almighty Dollar is but an accidental
symbol of the Almighty soul of man. And it’s the
soul that we’re proud of and that keeps the nation
together. All this more or less was at the back of
my mind when I said where there’s a soul there’s a
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As this little speech progressed her face lost its expression
of serene and humorous contentment with the
world, and grew eager and her eyes shone and her
voice quickened. He regarded her as some fainéant
Homeric warrior might have regarded the goddess
who had descended cloud-haste from Olympus to exhort
him to noble deeds. The exhortation fluttered
both pride and pulses. He saw in her a woman capable
of great things and she had appealed to him as a
man also capable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have pointed me out the way to Egypt,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad,” said Lucilla. “Look me up when you
get there,” she added with a smile. “It seems a big
place, but it isn’t. Cairo, Luxor, Assouan—and at any
rate the Semiramis Hotel at Cairo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she began to talk of that wonderful land,
of the mystery of the desert, the inscrutable gods of
granite and Karnac brooding over the ghost of Thebes.
She spoke from wide knowledge and sympathy. An
allusion here and there indicated how true a touch she
had on far divergent aspects of life. Apart from her
radiant adorableness which held him captive, she possessed
a mind which stimulated his own so long lain
sluggish. He had not met before the highly educated
woman of the world. Instinctively he contrasted her
with Corinna, who in the first days of their pilgrimage
had dazzled him with her attainments. She had
a quick intelligence, but in any matter of knowledge
was soon out of her depth; yet she exhibited singular
adroitness in regaining the shallows where she found
safety in abiding. Lucilla, on the other hand, swam
serenely out into deep blue water. From every point
of view she was a goddess of bewildering attributes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while she shivered slightly. The sun had
disappeared behind a corner of the hotel. Greyness
overspread the terrace. The glory of the short winter
afternoon had departed. She rose, Heliogabalus, also
shivering, under her arm. Martin held the rugs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” said she, “whether you could possibly
send up some tea to my quaint little salon. Perhaps
you might induce Félise to join me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all the talk he had with her. In the evening
the arrival of an English motor party kept him
busy, both during dinner and afterwards; for not only
did they desire coffee and liqueurs served in the vestibule,
but they gave indications to his experienced judgment
of requiring relays of whiskies and sodas until
bedtime. Again he did not visit the Café de l’Univers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning she started for the Riviera. She
was proceeding thither via Toulouse, Carcassonne,
Narbonne and the coast. To Martin’s astonishment
Félise was accompanying her, on a visit for ten days
or a fortnight to the South. It appeared that the
matter had been arranged late the previous evening.
Lucilla had made the proposal, swept away difficulty
after difficulty with her air of a smiling, but irresistible
providence and left Bigourdin and Félise not a
leg save sheer churlishness to stand on. Clothes?
She had ten times the amount she needed. The perils
of the lonely and tedious return train journey? Never
could Félise accomplish it. Bigourdin turned up an
<span class='it'>Indicateur des Chemins de Fer</span>. There were changes,
there were waits. Communications were arranged,
with diabolical cunning, not to correspond. Perhaps
it was to confound the Germans in case of invasion.
As far as he could make out it would take seventy-four
hours, forty-three minutes to get from Monte
Carlo to Brantôme. It was far simpler to go from
Paris to Moscow, which as every one knew was the
end of the world. Félise would starve. Félise would
perish of cold. Félise would get the wrong train and
find herself at Copenhagen or Amsterdam or Naples,
where she wouldn’t be able to speak the language. Lucilla
laughed. There was such a thing as L’Agence
Cook which moulded the <span class='it'>Indicateur des Chemins de
Fer</span> to its will. She would engage a man from Cook’s
before whose brass-buttoned coat and a gold-lettered
cap band the Indicateur would fall to pieces, to transfer
Félise personally, by easy stages, from house to house.
Félise had pleaded her uncle’s need. Lucilla, in the
most charming way imaginable, had deprecated as impossible
any such colossal selfishness on the part of
Monsieur Bigourdin. Overawed by the Olympian he
had peremptorily ordered Félise to retire and pack her
trunk. Then, obeying the dictates of his sound sense
he had asked Lucilla what object she had in her magnificent
invitation. His little girl, said he, would acquire
a taste for celestial things which never afterwards
would she be in a position to gratify. To which,
Lucilla:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know she won’t be able to gratify
them? A girl of her beauty, charm and character,
together with a little knowledge of the world of men,
women and things, is in a position to command whatever
she chooses. She has the beauty, charm and character
and I want to add the little knowledge. I want
to see a lovely human flower expand”—she had a graceful
trick of restrained gesture which impressed Bigourdin.
“I want to give a bruised little girl whom
I’ve taken to my heart a good time. For myself, it’s
some sort of way of finding a sanction for my otherwise
useless existence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Bigourdin clutching at his bristles had plucked
forth no adequately inspired reply. The will of the
New World had triumphed over that of the Old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the staff of the hotel witnessed the departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Martin,” said Félise in French, about to
step into the great car, a medley, to her mind, of
fur rugs and dark golden dogs and grey cats and
maids and chauffeurs and innumerable articles of luggage,
“I have scarcely had two words with you. I
no longer know where I have my head. But look
after my uncle and see that the laundress does not
return the table-linen black.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bien</span>, Mademoiselle Félise,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucilla, pink and white and leopard-coated, shook
hands with Bigourdin, thanked him for his hospitality
and reassured him as to the perfect safety of
Félise. She stepped into the car. Martin arranged
the rugs and closed the door. She held out her hand
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We meet in Egypt,” she said in a low voice. As
the car drove off, she turned round and blew a gracious
kiss to the little group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Voilà une petite sorcière d’Américaine</span>,” said Bigourdin.
“Pif! Paf! and away goes Félise on her
broomstick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stood shocked at hearing his Divinity
maligned as a witch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here am I,” continued Bigourdin, “between pretty
sheets. I have no longer a housekeeper, seeing that
Madame Thuillier rendered herself unbearable. However”—he
shrugged his shoulders resignedly—“we
must get on by ourselves as best we can. The trip
will be good for the health of Félise. It will also
improve her mind. She will stay in many hotels and
observe their organisation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the moment that Martin returned to his duties
he felt unusual lack of zeal in their performance. Deprived
of the Celestial Presence the Hôtel des Grottes
seemed to be stricken with a blight The rooms had
grown smaller and barer, the furniture more common,
and the terrace stretched outside a bleak concrete
wilderness. Often he stood on the bridge and repeated
the question of the memorable evening. What
was he doing there when the wide world was illuminated
by a radiant woman? Suddenly Bigourdin,
Félise, the circle of the Café de l’Univers became alien
in speech and point of view. He upbraided himself
for base ingratitude. He realised, more from casual
talk with Bigourdin, than from sense of something
wanting, the truth of Félise’s last remark. In the
usual intimate order of things she would have related
her experiences of Chartres and Paris in which he
would have manifested a more than brotherly interest.
During her previous absence he had thought much of
Félise and had anticipated her return with a throb of
the heart. The dismissal of Lucien Viriot, much as he
admired the gallant ex-cuirassier, pleased him mightily.
He had shared Bigourdin’s excitement over the
escape from Chartres, over Fortinbras’s prohibition of
the marriage, over her return in motoring state. When
she had freed herself from Bigourdin’s embrace, and
turned to greet him, the clasp of her two little hands
and the sight of her eager little face had thrilled
him. He had told her, as though she belonged to him,
of the things he knew she was dying to hear.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And then the figure of the American girl with her
stately witchery had walked through the door of the
<span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span> into his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days went on dully, shortening and darkening
as they neared Christmas. Félise wrote letters to her
uncle, artlessly filled with the magic of the South.
Two letters from Lucilla Merriton decreed extension
of her guest’s visit. Bigourdin began to lose his genial
view of existence. He talked gloomily of France’s
unreadiness for war. There were thieves and traitors
in the Cabinet. Whole Army Corps were notoriously
deficient in equipment and transport. It was enough,
he declared, to make a patriotic Frenchman commit
protesting suicide in the lobby of the Chamber of Deputies.
And what news had Martin received of Mademoiselle
Corinna? Martin knew little save that she
was engaged in some mysterious work in London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is she doing?” cried Bigourdin, at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t the remotest idea,” replied Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dites donc, mon ami</span>,” said Bigourdin, the gloom
of anxiety deepening on his brow. “You do not
think, by any chance”—he hesitated before breathing
the terrible surmise—“you do not think she has made
herself a suffragette?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I tell?” replied Martin. “With Corinna
all things are possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Except to take command of the Hôtel des Grottes,”
said Bigourdin, and he sighed vastly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening he said: “My good friend Martin, I
am feeling upset. Instead of going to the Café de
l’Univers, let us have a glass of the <span class='it'>vieille fine du
Brigadier</span> in the <span class='it'>petit salon</span> where I have ordered
Marie to make a good fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Liqueur Brandy of the Brigadier was literally,
from the market standpoint, worth its weight
in gold. In the seventies Bigourdin’s father, during
the course of reparations, had discovered, in a blocked
and forgotten cellar, three almost evaporated casks
bearing the inscription just decipherable beneath the
mildew in Brigadier General Bigourdin’s old war-dog
handwriting: “Cognac. 1812.” His grandson, who
had lost a leg and an arm in 1870, knew what was
due to the brandy of the <span class='it'>Grande Armée</span>. Instead of
filling up the casks with newer brandy and selling
the result at extravagant prices, he reverently bottled
the remaining contents of the three casks and on each
bottle stuck a printed label setting forth the great
history of the brandy, and stored the lot in a dry bin
which he charged his son to venerate as one of the
sacred depositaries of France in the family of Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now in any first-class restaurant in Paris, Monte
Carlo, Aix-les-Bains, you can get Napoleon Brandy.
The bottle sealed with the still mind-stirring initial
“N” on the neck, is uncorked solemnly before you by
the silver-chained functionary. It is majestic liquid.
But not a drop of the distillation of the Napoleonic
grape is there. The casks once containing it have
been filled and refilled for a hundred years. For
brandy unlike port does not mature in bottle. The
best 1812 brandy bottled that year would be to-day
the same as it was then. But if it has remained for
over sixty years in cask, you shall have a precious
fluid such as it is given to few kings or even emperors
to taste. I doubt whether there are a hundred gallons
of it in the wide, wide world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proposal to open a bottle of the Old Brandy of
the Brigadier portended a state of affairs so momentous
that Martin gaped at the back of Bigourdin on
his way to the cellar. On the occasion of what high
solemnity the last had been uncorked, Martin did not
know: certainly not on the occasion of the dinner
of ceremony to the Viriots, in spite of the fact that the
father of the prospective bridegroom was <span class='it'>marchand de
vins en gros</span> and was expected by Bigourdin to produce
at the return dinner some of his famous Chambertin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Bigourdin, cobwebbed bottle in hand,
and Martin followed him into the prim little salon.
From a cupboard whose glass doors were veiled with
green-pleated silk, he produced two mighty quart
goblets which he set down on a small table, and
into each poured about a sherry-glass of the precious
brandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like this,” he explained, “we do not lose the perfume.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin sipped; it was soft like wine and the delicate
flavour lingered deliciously on tongue and palate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like to think,” said Bigourdin, “that it contains
the soul of the <span class='it'>Grande Armée</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat in stiff arm chairs covered in stamped
velvet, one on each side of the wood fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend,” said Bigourdin, lighting a cigarette,
“I am not as contented with the world as perhaps I
ought to be. I had an interview with Monsieur Viriot
to-day which distressed me a great deal. The two
families have been friends and the Viriots have supplied
us with wine on an honourable understanding
for generations. But the understanding was purely
mercantile and did not involve the sacrifice of a virgin.
<span class='it'>Le Père</span> Viriot seems to think that it did. I exposed to
him the disinclination of Félise, and the impossibility
of obtaining that which is necessary, according to the
law, the consent of her parents. He threw the parents
to the four winds of heaven. He conducted himself
like a man bereft of reason. Always beware of the
obstinacy of a flat-headed man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was the result of the interview?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We quarrelled for good and all. We quitted each
other as enemies. He sent round his clerk this afternoon
with his account, and I paid it in cash down to
the last centime. And now I shall have to go to the
Maison Prunier of Périgueux, who are incapable of
any honourable understanding and will try to supply
me with abominable beverages which will poison and
destroy my clientèle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recklessly he finished his brandy and poured himself
out another portion. Then he passed the bottle
to Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sers-toi</span>,” said he, using for the first time the familiar
second person singular. Martin was startled, but
said nothing. Then he remembered that Bigourdin,
contrary to his usual abstemious habits, had been supplied
at dinner with a cradled quart of old Corton
which awakens generosity of sentiment towards their
fellows in the hearts of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon brave</span>,” he remarked, after a pause, “my
heart is full of problems which I cannot resolve and
I have no one to turn to but yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I appreciate your saying so very much,” replied
Martin; “but why not consult our wise and experienced
friend Fortinbras?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Voilà</span>,” cried Bigourdin, waving a great hand. “It
is he who sets me the greatest problem of all. Why
do you think I have let Félise go away with that pretty
whirlwind of an American?” Martin stiffened, not
knowing whether this was a disparagement of Lucilla;
but Bigourdin, heedless, continued: “It is because
she is very unhappy, and it is out of human
power to give her consolation. You are a gentleman
and a man of honour. I will repose in you a
sacred confidence. But that which I am going to tell
you, you will swear never to reveal to a living soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin gave his word. Bigourdin, without touching
on long-past sorrows, described the visit of Félise
to the Rue Maugrabine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my sister,” said he, “for years sunk in
the degradation of drunkenness—so rare among
Frenchwomen—it is madness, <span class='it'>que veux-tu</span>? Often
she has gone away to be cured, with no effect. I
have urged my brother-in-law to put her away permanently
in a <span class='it'>maison de santé</span>; but he has not been
willing. It was he, he maintains, who in far-off, unhappy
days, when, <span class='it'>pauvre garçon</span>, he lifted his elbow
too often himself, gave her the taste for alcohol. For
that reason he treats her with consideration and even
tenderness. <span class='it'>Cest beau.</span> And he himself, you must
have remarked, has not drunk anything but water for
many years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Martin, and his mind went back
to his first meeting with Fortinbras in the lonely Petit
Cornichon, when the latter imbibed such prodigious
quantities of raspberry syrup and water. It seemed
very long ago. Bigourdin went on talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so,” said he, at last, “you see the unhappy situation
which Fortinbras, like a true Don Quixote, has
arranged between himself and Félise. She retains the
sacred ideal of her mother, but holds in horror, very
naturally, the father whom she has always adored. It
is a bleeding wound in her innocent little soul. What
can I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was deeply moved by the pitifulness of the
tale. Poor little Félise, how much she must have
suffered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would it not be better,” said he, “to sacrifice a
phantom mother—for that’s what it comes to—for the
sake of a living father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin agreed, but Fortinbras expressly forbade
such a disclosure. In this he sympathised with Fortinbras,
although the mother was his own flesh and
blood. Truly he had not been lucky in sisters—one
a <span class='it'>bigote</span> and the other an <span class='it'>alcoolique</span>. He expressed
sombre views as to the family of which he was the
sole male survivor. Seeing that his wife had
given him no children, and that he had not the heart
to marry one of the damsels of the neighbourhood,
he bewailed the end of the good old name of Bigourdin.
But perhaps it were best. For who could tell, if he
begat a couple of children, whether one would not
be afflicted with alcoholic, and the other with religious
mania? To beget brave children for France, a man,
<span class='it'>nom de Dieu</span>! must put forth all the splendour and
audacity of his soul. How could he do so, when the
only woman who could conjure up within him the said
splendour and audacity would have nothing to do with
him? To fall in love with a woman was a droll affair.
But if you loved her, you loved her, however
little she responded. It was a species of malady which
must be supported with courageous resignation. He
sighed and poured out a third glass of the brandy of
the Brigadier. Martin did likewise, thinking of the
woman whose white fingers held the working of the
splendour and audacity of the soul of Martin Overshaw.
He felt drawn into brotherly sympathy with
Bigourdin; but, for the life of him, he could not see
how anybody could be dependent for soul provisions
of splendour and audacity upon Corinna Hastings.
The humbly aspiring fellow moved him to patronising
pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin strove to comfort him with specious words
of hope. But Bigourdin’s mental condition was that
of a man to whom wallowing in despair alone brings
consolation. He had been suffering from a gathering
avalanche of misfortunes. First had come his rejection,
followed by the unsatisfied longing of the devout
lover. It cannot be denied, however, that he had
borne himself gallantly. Then the fading of his dream
of the Viriot alliance had filled him with dismay.
Félise’s adventure in the Rue Maugrabine and its resulting
situation had caused him sleepless nights. Lucilla
Merriton had taken him up between her fingers
and twiddled him round, thereby depriving him of
volition, and having put him down in a state of bewilderment,
had carried off Félise. And to-day, last
accretion that set the avalanche rolling, his old friend
Viriot had called him a breaker of honourable understandings
and had sent a clerk with his bill. The avalanche
swept him into the Slough of Despond, wherein
he lay solacing himself with hopeless imaginings and
the old brandy of the Brigadier. But human instinct
made him beckon to Martin, call him “<span class='it'>tu</span>” and bid him
to keep an eye on the quagmire and stretch out a
helping hand. He also had in view a subtle and daring
scheme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon brave ami</span>,” said he, “when I die”—his broad
face assumed an expression of infinite woe and he
spoke as though he were seventy—“what will become
of the Hôtel des Grottes? Félise will benefit principally,
<span class='it'>bien entendu</span>, by my will; but she will marry one
of these days and will follow her husband, who probably
will not want to concern himself with hotel
keeping.” He glanced shrewdly at Martin, who regarded
him with unmoved placidity. “To think that
the hotel will be sold and all its honourable traditions
changed would break my heart. I should not like to
die without any solution of continuity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear Bigourdin,” said Martin, “what are
you thinking of? You’re a young man. You’re not
stricken with a fatal malady. You’re not going to
die. You have twenty, thirty, perhaps forty years before
you in the course of which all kinds of things
may happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin leant forward and stretched out his great
arm across the fireplace until his fingers touched Martin’s
knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what is going to happen? War is
going to happen. Next year—the year after—five
years hence—<span class='it'>que sais-je, moi?</span>—but it has to come.
All these pacifists and anti-militarists are either imbeciles
or traitors—those that are not dreaming mad-house
dreams of the millennium are filling their pockets—of
the latter there are some in high places. There
is going to be war, I tell you, and many people are
going to die. And when the bugle sounds I put on
my old uniform and march to the cannon’s mouth like
my fathers before me. And why shouldn’t I die, like
my brother in Morocco? Tell me that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of his intimacy with the sturdy thought of
provincial France, Martin could not realise how the
vague imminence of war could affect so closely the
personal life of an individual Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter,” said Bigourdin, after a short discussion.
“I have to die some day. It was not to argue
about the probable date of my decease that I have
asked you to honour me with this special conversation.
I have expressed to you quite frankly the motives
which actuate me at the present moment. I have
done so in order that you may understand why I desire
to make you a business proposition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A business proposition?” echoed Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oui, mon ami.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He replenished Martin’s enormous beaker and his
own and gave the toast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A l’Entente Cordiale</span>—between our nations and between
our two selves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lest the uninitiated may regard this sitting as a
dram drinking orgy, it must be borne in mind that
in such brandy as that of the Brigadier, strength has
melted into the gracious mellowness of old age. The
fiery spirit that the <span class='it'>cantinière</span> or the <span class='it'>vivandière</span> of 1812
served out of her little waist-slung barrel to the warriors
of the <span class='it'>Grande Armée</span>, was now but a fragrant
memory of battles long ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A business proposition,” repeated Bigourdin, and
forthwith began to develop it. It was the very simplest
business proposition in the world. Why should
not Martin invest all or part of his little heritage in
the century-old and indubitably flourishing business
of the Hôtel des Grottes, and become a partner with
Bigourdin? Lawyers would arrange the business details.
In this way, whether Bigourdin met with a
gory death within the next two or three years or a
peaceful one a quarter of a century hence, he would
be reassured that there would be no solution of continuity
in the honourable tradition of the Hôtel des
Grottes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that Martin fully understood the solemnity
of the occasion—the <span class='it'>petit salon</span> with fire specially
lit, the Brigadier brandy, the preparatory revelation
of the soul-state of Bigourdin. The unexpectedness
of the suggestion, however, dazed him. He said
politely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear friend, your proposal that I should associate
myself with you in this business is a personal
compliment, which I shall never cease to appreciate.
But——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must think over it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally,” said Bigourdin. “One would be a linnet
or a butterfly instead of a man if one took a step
like that without thinking. But at least the idea is
not disagreeable to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” replied Martin. “The only question
is how should I get the money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your little heritage, <span class='it'>parbleu</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that is in Consols—<span class='it'>rentes anglaises</span>, and I
only get my dividends twice a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could sell out to-morrow or the next day and
get the whole in bank notes or golden sovereigns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I could,” said Martin. Not till then had
he realised the simple fact that if he chose he could
walk about with a sack of a thousand sovereigns over
his shoulder. He had taken it in an unspeculative
way for granted that the capital remained locked up
behind impassable doors in the Bank of England. Instinct,
however, restrained him from confessing to
Bigourdin such innocence in business affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I did not think it would be as safe here as in
the hands of the British Government, I would not
make the suggestion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin started upright in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear friend, I know that,” he cried ingenuously,
horrified lest he should be thought to suspect
Bigourdin’s good faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you would no longer wear that costume.” Bigourdin
smiled and waved a hand towards the dress-suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is beginning to show signs of wear,” said
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced down and caught sight of the offending
splotch of grease. The quick association of ideas
caused a vision of Lucilla to pass before his eyes. He
heard her rich, deep voice: “We meet in Egypt.”
But how the deuce could they meet in Egypt or in any
other Lucilla-lit spot on the earth if he started inn-keeping
with Bigourdin, and tied himself down for
life to Brantôme? A chill ran down his spine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Eh, bien?</span>” said Bigourdin, recalling him to the
<span class='it'>petit salon</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had an inspiration of despair. “I should
like,” said he, “to talk the matter over with Fortinbras.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is what I should advise,” said Bigourdin heartily.
“You can go to Paris whenever you like. And now
<span class='it'>n’en parlons plus</span>. I feel much happier than at the beginning
of the evening. It is the brandy of the brave
old Brigadier. Let us empty the bottle and drink to
the repose of his soul. He would ask nothing better.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> days went on, and nothing more was said of
the proposal, it being understood that, as soon
as Félise had wrought order out of chaos for
a second time, Martin should consult with Fortinbras,
his bankers, his solicitors and other eminent advisers.
They resumed their evening visits to the Café de
l’Univers, where Bigourdin and Monsieur Viriot sat
as far apart as was consonant with membership of the
circle. On meeting they saluted each other with elaborate
politeness and addressed each other as “Monsieur”
when occasion required interchange of speech. Every
one knew what had happened, and, as every one was
determined that the strained relations between them
should not interfere with his own personal comfort,
nobody cared. The same games were played, the
same arguments developed. A favourite theme was the
probable action of the Socialists on the outbreak of
war. Some held, Monsieur Viriot among them, that
they would refuse to take up arms and would spread
counsels of ignominy among the people. The Professor
at the Ecole Normale, allowed to express latitudinarian
views on account of his philosophic position,
was of opinion that the only safeguard against
a European war lay in the solidarity of the International
Socialist Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Prussian drill-sergeant,” said the Mayor,
“will soon see that there is no solidarity as far as Germany
is concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have no drill-sergeants. The <span class='it'>sous-officier</span> is
under the officer who is under the general who is
bought by the men we are so besotted as to put into
power to play into the hands of the enemy. Our Socialists
will cleave to their infamous principles.” Thus
declared Monsieur Viriot, who was a reactionary republican
and regarded Socialism and Radicalism and
Anti-clericalism as punishments inflicted by an outraged
Heaven on a stiff-necked generation. “The Socialist
will betray us,” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur,” replied Bigourdin loftily, “you are
wrong to accuse the loyalty of your compatriots. I
am not a socialist. I, as every one knows, hold their
mischievous ideas in detestation. But I have faith in
the human soul. There’s not a Socialist, not an Anarchist,
not even an Apache, who, when the German
cannon sounds in his ears, will not rush to shed his
blood in the defence of the sacred soil of France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo!” cried one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est bien dit!</span>” cried another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, the soil is in the blood,” said a third.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Cazensac, the landlord, who stood listening,
said with a certain Gascon mordancy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scratch even a Minister and you will find a Frenchman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the discussion—and who shall say it was
a profitless one?—went on evening after evening, as
it had gone on, in some sort of fashion conditioned
by circumstances for over forty years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Christmas Eve came Félise, convoyed as far as
Périgueux, where Bigourdin met her train, by the
promised man from Cook’s. It was a changed little
Félise, flushed with health and armoured in sophistication
that greeted Martin. Her first preoccupation was
no longer the disasters that might have occurred under
helpless male rule during her absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had the time of my life,” she asserted with a
curious lazy accent. “It would take weeks to tell you.
Monte Carlo is too heavenly for words. Lucilla committed
perjury and swore I was over twenty-one and
got me into the rooms and into the Sports Club, and
what do you think? I won a thousand francs,” she
tapped her bosom. “I have it here in good French
money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stared. The face was the face of Félise,
but the voice was the voice of Lucilla. The English
too of Félise was no longer her pretty halting speech,
but fluent, as though, by her frequentation of English-speaking
folk, all the old vocabulary of childhood had
returned, together with sundry accretions. She rattled
off a succinct account of the loveliness of the Azure
Coast, with its flowers and seas and sunshine, the
motor drives she had taken, the lunches, dinners and
suppers she had eaten, the people she had met. Lucilla
seemed to have friends everywhere, mainly English
and American. They had seldom been alone. Félise
had lived all the time in a social whirl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find Brantôme very dull now, Félise,” said
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “If you think my head’s turned,
you’re mistaken. It’s a little head more solid than
that.” Then, growing serious—“What I have seen
and heard yonder, in a different sort of world, will
enable me to form a truer judgment of things in Brantôme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin came near the truth when he remarked
later with a smile and a sigh:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is our little girl transformed, in a twinkling,
into a woman. She has acquired the art of hiding her
troubles and of mocking at her tears. She will tell
me henceforward only what it pleases her that I should
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise took up her duties cheerfully, performing
them with the same thoroughness as before, but with
a certain new and sedate authority. Her pretty assumption
of dignified command had given place to
calm assertion. Euphémie and Baptiste accustomed
to girlish rebukes and rejoinders grumbled at the new
phase. When Félise cut short the hitherto wonted argument
by a: “<span class='it'>Ma bonne Euphémie</span>, the way it is to
be done is the way I want it done,” and marched off
like a duchess unperturbed, Euphémie shook her head
and wondered whether she were still in the same situation.
In her attitude towards Martin, she became more
formal as a mistress and more superficial as friend.
She had caught the trick of easy talk, which might
have disconcerted him had the world been the same as
it was before the advent of Lucilla. But the world had
changed. He lived in Brantôme an automatic existence,
his body there, his spirit far away. His mind
dwelt little on any possible deepening or hardening
in the character of Félise. So her altered attitude,
though he could not help noticing it, caused him no
disturbance. He thought casually: “Compared with
the men she has met in the great world, I am but a
person of mediocre interest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The New Year came in, heralded by snow and ice
all over Europe. Beneath the steel-blue sky Brantôme
looked pinched with cold. The hotel was almost empty,
and Martin found it hard to occupy long hours of chilly
idleness otherwise than by dreaming of Lucilla and
palms and sunshine. Lucilla of course was always
under the palms and the palms were in the sunshine;
and he was talking to Lucilla, alone with her in the
immensities of the desert. When he had dreamed
long enough he shivered, for the Hôtel des Grottes
still depended for warmth on wood fires and there
was no central heating and the bath in the famous bathroom
received hot water through a gas geyser. And
then he wondered whether the time had not come for
him to make his momentous journey to Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had a letter from Miss Merriton,” said Félise
one day, “she asks for news of you and sends you her
kind regards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, who, in shirt-sleeves and apron, was laying
tables in the <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>, flushed at his goddess’s
message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very good of her to remember me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she remembers you right enough,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That meant that his goddess must have spoken of
him, not only once but on various occasions. She had
carried him so far in her thoughts as to be interested
in his doings. Did her words imply a veiled query as
to his journey into Egypt? A lover reads an infinity
of significance in his mistress’s most casual utterance,
but blandly fails to interpret the obvious tone in which
the woman with whom he is not in love makes an acid
remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Miss Merriton now?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She informed him coldly—not at all with the air of
the wild flowers from which Alpine honey is made—that
Lucilla was sailing next week for Alexandria.
“And,” said she, “as I am a sort of messenger, what
reply shall I make?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, who had developed a lover’s cunning, answered:
“Give her my respectful greetings and say
that I am very well.” No form of words could be less
compromising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same evening, on their cold way back from the
Café de l’Univers, Bigourdin said, using as he had
done since the night of the intimate conversation the
“<span class='it'>tu</span>” of familiarity:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that Félise has returned, and all goes on
wheels and business is slack, don’t you think it is a
good opportunity for you to go to Paris for your
holiday and your consultations?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go the day after to-morrow,” replied Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you told Félise of your proposed journey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est bien.</span> When you tell her, say it is for the
sake of a change, your health, your little affairs, what
you will. It is better that she should not know of our
scheme until it is all arranged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that would be wiser,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the event of your accepting my proposition,”
said Bigourdin, after a pause, “have you ever thought
of the possibility of becoming a naturalised Frenchman?
Like that, perhaps, business might roll more
smoothly. We have already spoken, you and I, of
your becoming a good Périgordin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, hands in pockets and shoulders hunched so
as to obtain ear-shelter beneath the upturned collar
of his great coat, was silent for a few moments.
Then—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nationality is a strange thing,” said he. “The
more I live in France, the more proud I am of being
an Englishman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin sprang a pace apart, wounded to the
quick. “<span class='it'>Mais non par exemple!</span> You of all men,” and
it was the “vous” of formality, “ought not to say that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais que tu es bête!</span> You misunderstand me. You
don’t let me proceed,” cried Martin, halting before him
in the semi-darkness of the quay. “In France I have
learned the meaning of the word patriotism. I have
been surrounded here with the love of country, and I
have reflected. This impulse is so strong in all French
hearts, ought it not to be as strong in the heart of
an Englishman? France has taught me the finest of
lessons. I am as loyal a Frenchman as any of our
friends at the Café de l’Univers, but—” adapting a
vague reminiscence of the lyric to Lucasta—“I should
not love France so much, if I did not love England
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon brave ami!</span>” cried Bigourdin, holding out
both hands, in a Frenchman’s instinctive response to
a noble sentiment adequately expressed, “Pardon me.
Let us say no more about it. The true Englishman
who loves France is a better friend to us than the
Englishman who has lost his love for England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went to bed in a somewhat tortured frame
of mind. He was very simple, very honest, very conscientious.
It was true that the flame of French patriotism
had kindled the fire of English patriotism
within him. It was true that he had learned to love
this sober, intense, kindly land of France. It was true
that here was a generous bosom of France willing to
enfold him, an alien, like one of her own sons. But
it was equally true that in his ears rang a clarion call
sounded not by mother England, not by foster-mother
France, but by <span class='it'>une petite sorcière Américaine</span>, a fair
witch neither of England nor of France, but from
beyond the estranging seas. And the day after to-morrow
he was journeying to Paris to take the advice
of Fortinbras, <span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur</span>. What would
the dealer in happiness decide? To wait until some
turn of Fortune’s wheel should change his career and
set him free to wander forth across the world, or to
invest his all in an inglorious though comfortable future?
Either way there would be heart-racking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bigourdin, as he secured the Hôtel des Grottes
with locks and bolts, whistled “<span class='it'>Malbrouck s’en va-t-en
guerre</span>,” a sign of his being pleased with existence. He
had no doubt of Fortinbras’s decision. Fortinbras had
practically given it in a letter he had received that
afternoon. For he had told Fortinbras his proposal,
which was based on the certainty of a marriage between
Félise and Martin, as soon as the latter should
find himself in a position that would warrant a declaration
up to now impossible to a man of delicate honour.
“They think I am an old mole,” he had written, “but
for certain things I have the eyes of a hawk. Why
did Félise suddenly refuse Lucien Viriot? Why has
Martin during her last absence been in a state of depression
lamentable to behold? And now that Félise
has returned, changed from a young girl into that
thing of mystery, a woman, why are their relations
once so fraternal marked by an exquisite politeness?
And why must Martin travel painful hours in a train
in order to consult the father of Félise? Tell me
all that! When it comes to real diplomacy, <span class='it'>mon
vieux</span> Daniel, trust the solid head of Gaspard Bigourdin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which excerpt affords a glimpse into the workings
of a subtle yet ingenuous mind. He hummed “<span class='it'>Malbrouck
s’en var-t-en guerre</span>” as he went upstairs. The
little American witch never crossed his thoughts, nor
did a possible application of the line “<span class='it'>Ne sais quand
reviendra</span>.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The High Gods hold this world in an uncertain balance;
and, whenever they decree to turn things topsy-turvy,
they have only to flick it the myriadth part of
a millimetre. The very next day they gave it such a
flick, and it was Bigourdin and not Martin who went
to Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ma petite</span> Félise,” said Bigourdin the next day, “I
have received this morning from Paris a telegram
despatched last night summoning me thither on urgent
business. I may be away three or four days,
during which I have arranged for the excellent Madame
Chauvet who devoted such maternal care to
you on the journey to Chartres to stay here <span class='it'>pour les
convenances</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subtle diplomatist smiled; so that when she
questioned him as to the nature of this urgent business
and he replied that it was a worrying matter of
lawyers and stockbrokers, she accepted the explanation.
But to Martin—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon pauvre ami</span>,” said he, with woe-begone face,
“it is the mother of Félise. She is dying. A syncope.
We must not let Félise know or she would insist
on accompanying me, which would be impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin took a detached view of the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” he asked. “She is a woman now and
able to accept her share in the tragedy of life with
courage and with reason. Why not let her go and
learn the truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin waved a gesture of despair. “I detest
like you this deception. Lying is as foreign to my
character as to yours. But <span class='it'>que veux-tu</span>? In the
tragedy of my brother-in-law there is something at
once infinitely piteous and sublime. In a matter like
this the commands of a father are sacred. Ah, my
poor Cécile!” said he, passing a great hand swiftly
across his eyes. “Twenty years ago, what a pretty
girl she was! Of a character somewhat difficult and
bizarre. But I loved her more than my sister Clothilde,
who had all the virtues of the <span class='it'>petite rosaire</span>.”
He fetched a deep sigh. “One is bound to believe in
the eternal wisdom of the All-Powerful. There is
nothing between that and the lunatic caprice of an
almighty mad goat. That is why I hold to Christianity
and embark on this terrible journey with fortitude and
resignation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held out his packet of <span class='it'>Bastos</span> to Martin. They
lit cigarettes. To give this confidential information
he had drawn Martin into the murky little <span class='it'>bureau</span>
whose window looked upon the sad grey vestibule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry,” he said, “that your holiday has to
be postponed. But it will only be for a few days. In
the meantime I leave Félise in the loyal care of yourself
and the good Madame Chauvet.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin went to Paris and deposited his valise at
a little hotel in a little street off the Boulevard Sébastopol,
where generations of Bigourdins had stayed, perhaps
even the famous Brigadier General himself;
where the proposed entertainment of an Englishman
would have caused the host as much consternation as
that of a giraffe; where the beds were spotless, the
<span class='it'>cuisine</span> irreproachable and other arrangements of a
beloved and venerable antiquity. Here the good Périgordin
found a home from his home in Périgord.
The last thing a solid and virtuous citizen of central
France desires to do in Paris is to Parisianise himself.
The solid and virtuous inhabitants of Périgord went
to the Hôtel de la Dordogne which flourishes now and
feeds its customers as succulently as it did a hundred
years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having deposited his valise at this historic hostelry,
Bigourdin proceeded to the Rue Maugrabine. He had
never been there before, and his heart sank, as the
heart of Félise had sunk, when he mounted the grimy,
icy stairs and sought the home of Fortinbras. His
sister Clothilde, severe in awful mourning, admitted
him, encaged him in a ghostly embrace and conducted
him into the poverty-stricken living room where Fortinbras,
in rusty black and dingy white tie, stood waiting
to receive him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unfortunately, my dear Gaspard,” said Fortinbras,
“you are not in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened the flimsy door set in the paper-covered
match-board partition. Bigourdin entered the bedroom
and there, with blinds drawn and candles burning
at head and feet lay all that remained of Cécile
Fortinbras. He returned soon afterwards drying his
eyes, for memories of childhood had brought tears.
He wrung Fortinbras by the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, <span class='it'>mon vieux</span> Daniel, is the very sad end of a
life that was somewhat tragic; but you can console
yourself with the thought of your long devotion and
tenderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clothilde Robineau tossed her head and sniffed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see around me much evidence of those two
qualities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your reproaches, Clothilde,” said Fortinbras, “are
as just as Gaspard’s consolation is generous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you acknowledge, at last, that it was you
who dragged my unfortunate sister down to this
misery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras made no reply. Lives like his one must
understand and pardon as Bigourdin had done.
Nothing that he could say could mitigate the animosity
of Clothilde which he had originally incurred by marrying
her sister. She would be moved by no pleading
that it was his wife’s extravagance and intemperance
that had urged him to the mad tampering with other
people’s money (money honestly repaid, but all the
same diverted wrongly for a time) which had caused
him to be struck off the roll of solicitors and to leave
England a disgraced man. She would have retorted
that had he not been addicted to <span class='it'>boissons alcooliques</span>,
a term which in France always means fiery spirits,
and had he not led the life of the theatre and the restaurant,
Cécile would have been sober and thrifty like
herself and Gaspard. And Fortinbras would have
beat his breast saying “Mea culpa.” He might have
pleaded the after years of ceaseless struggle. But to
what end? As soon as his wife was laid beneath the
ground, Clothilde would gather together her skirts
and pass for ever out of his life. Bigourdin knew of
his remorse, his home of unending horror, his efforts
ever frustrated, the weight at his feet that not only
prevented him from rising, but dragged him gradually
down, down, down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even Bigourdin, who had not been to Paris for
ten years, had not appreciated till now the depths of
poverty into which Fortinbras and his sister had sunk.
His last visit to them had been painful. A drunken,
dishevelled hostess, especially when she is your own
sister, does not make for charm. But they lived in a
reputable apartment at Auteuil, and there was a good
carpet on the floor of the salon and chairs and tables
such as are found in Christian dwellings, and on the
mantelpiece stood the ormolu clock, and on the walls
hung the pictures which had once adorned their home
in London. How had they come down to this? He
shivered, cold and ill at ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you must be hungry after your long journey,
Gaspard,” said Madame Robineau, “I should advise
you to go out to a restaurant. The cuisine of the
<span class='it'>femme de journée</span> I do not recommend. For me, I
must keep watch, and it being Friday I fast as usual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras made no pretence at hospitality. Had
he been able to set forth a banquet, he felt that every
morsel would have been turned into stone by the
basilisk eyes of Clothilde. Both men rose simultaneously,
glad to be free. They went out, took an
omnibus haphazard and eventually entered a restaurant
in the neighbourhood of the Tour Saint-Jacques.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon vieux</span> Daniel,” said Bigourdin, as soon as
they were seated. “Tell me frankly, for I don’t understand.
How comes it that you are in these dreadful
straits?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras smiled sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One earns little by translating from French into
English and still less by dispensing happiness to
youth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——” Bigourdin hesitated. “But you have
had other resources—not much certainly, but still
something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” asked Fortinbras. “You
know that in five years Cécile scattered her own dowry
to the winds and left me at the edge of a whirlpool of
debt. All of my own I could scrape together and borrow
I threw in to save myself from prison. She had
no heritage from her father. On what else can we
have lived save on my precarious earnings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin, both elbows on the table, plucked at his
upstanding bristles and gazed intently at Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever since the great misfortune, when you returned
to France, Cécile has had her own income.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are dreaming, Gaspard. From what source
could she obtain an income?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From me, <span class='it'>parbleu</span>!” cried Bigourdin. “I always
thought my father’s will was unjust. Cécile should
have had her share. When I thought she needed assistance,
I arranged with my lawyer, Maître Dupuy, 33
Rue des Augustins, Paris, to allow her five thousand
francs a year in monthly instalments, and I know—<span class='it'>sacre
bleu!</span>—that it has been paid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras also put his elbows on the table, and the
two men looked close into each other’s faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know absolutely nothing about it. Cécile has
not had one penny that I have not given to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is horrible to speak like this,” said Bigourdin.
“But one cannot drink to excess without spending
much money. Where did she get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are alcohols unknown to the Hôtel des
Grottes, which it takes little money to buy. To get
that little she has pawned the sheets off the bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nom de Dieu!</span>” said Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a miserable meal, ending almost in silence.
When it was over they called at the cabinet of Maître
Dupuy. They found everything in order. Every
month for years past Madame Fortinbras had received
the sum of four hundred and sixteen francs, sixty-five
centimes. She had come personally for the money.
Maître Dupuy remembered his first interview with
Madame. She had expressly forbidden him to send
the money to the house lest it should fall into the hands
of her husband. He infinitely regretted to make such
a statement in the presence of Monsieur, but those were
the facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this is evidence in favour of what I told you,”
said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never doubted you!” cried Bigourdin, “and this
is proof. But what can she have done with all that
money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a mystery. They went back to the Rue Maugrabine.
On the way Fortinbras asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why have you never told me what you were doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I took it for granted that you knew, and that, <span class='it'>par
délicatesse</span>, the subject was not to be mentioned between
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Clothilde?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bigourdin was one of those who kept the left
hand in ignorance of the generous actions of the right.
He threw out his great arms, to the disturbance of
pedestrian traffic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Clothilde? What do you take me for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A day or two of continuous strain and hopelessness,
and then under the auspices of the <span class='it'>Pompes Funèbres</span>
and the clergy of the parish, the poor body of Cécile
Fortinbras was laid to rest. Not till then did any one
send word to Félise. Even Madame Robineau agreed
that it was best she should not know. As she had left
Chartres, self-willed and ungovernable, so, on the receipt
of the news of her mother’s death, might she
leave Brantôme. Her appearance amid these squalid
happenings would be <span class='it'>inconvenable</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no reason to love Félise,” she added. “But
she is a young girl of our family, and it is not correct
that she should see such things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the train carrying Madame Robineau back
to Chartres steamed out of the Gare Montparnasse,
both men drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon ami</span>,” said Bigourdin. “The Bible taught the
Church the beautiful history of Jesus Christ. The
Church told a Bishop. The Bishop told a priest. The
priest told the wife of the sub-prefect. The wife of
the sub-prefect told the wife of the mayor. The wife
of the mayor told the elderly, unmarried sister of the
corn-chandler, and the unmarried sister of the corn-chandler
told Clothilde. And that’s all she (Clothilde)
knows about Christianity. Still,” he added, in his judicious
way, “she is a woman of remarkable virtue.
She has a strong sense of duty. Without a particle of
love animating her heart, she has just spent three days
and nights without sleep, food or fresh air. It’s fine,
all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not ungrateful,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They entered a café for the sake of shelter from
the bitter January wind, and they talked, as they had
done lately, of many intimate things; of the past, of
Martin, of the immediate future. Fortinbras would
not accompany Bigourdin to Brantôme. His presence
would only add poignancy to the grief of Félise.
It was more impossible now than ever to undeceive
her, as one could not speak ill of the dead. No; he
would remain in Paris, where he had much to do.
First he must move from the Rue Maugrabine. The
place would be haunted. Besides, what did one old
vagabond want with two rooms and a kitchen? He
would sell his few belongings, and take a furnished
room somewhere among the chimney-pots.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bigourdin
lifted his <span class='it'>petit verre</span> of Armagnac, and forgetting
all about it, put it down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I am going to tell you,” said he, “may seem
cynical, but it is only common sense. Do not leave the
Rue Maugrabine without having searched every corner,
every box, every garment, every piece of furniture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Search?—what for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little economies of Cécile,” said Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras put up a protesting hand. Instinct revolted.
“Impossible!” he declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin persisted. “Although you have lived
long in the country and been married to a Frenchwoman,
you do not know, like myself who have it in
my veins, of what the peasant blood of France is
capable where money is concerned. It is impossible
on your own showing, that Cécile should have spent
five thousand francs a year. You have seen for yourself
that she received the money. What has she done
with it?” He leaned across the table and with great
forefinger tapped the shoulder of Fortinbras. “She
has hoarded it. It is there in the Rue Maugrabine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras shook his leonine head. “It was absurd.
In the olden days, when she had money, had she not
scattered it recklessly?” Bigourdin agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then,” said he, “you struck misfortune, poverty.
Did you not observe a change in her habits, and
in her character? Of course, we have often spoken
of it. It was the outer trappings of the bourgeois that
had disappeared and the <span class='it'>paysanne</span> asserted herself.
For many years my father supported my mother’s
mother, a peasant from La Beauce who gave out that
she was penniless. When she died they accidentally
found the mattress of her bed stuffed with a little fortune.
The blood of Grandmère Tidier ran in the veins
of Cécile. And Cécile like all the family knew of the
fortune of Grandmère Tidier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that in Fortinbras was half-forgotten, buried
beneath the rubbish heap of years, again protested: his
gently nurtured childhood, his smooth English home,
his impeccable Anglo-Indian father, Major-General
Fortinbras, who had all the servants in morning and
evening for family prayers and read the lessons in
the little village church on Sundays, his school-days—Winchester,
with its noble traditions—all, as we English
understand it, that goes to the making of an honourable
gentleman. If Pactolus, dammed by his wife,
poured through the kitchen taps, he would not turn
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I then that will do it,” said Bigourdin. “I am
not Anti-Semite in any way; but to present a Jew
dealer, who is already very well off, with many thousands
of francs is the act of an imbecile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed off his glass of Armagnac, beckoned the
waiter, threw down the coins for payment and rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Allons!</span>” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras, exhausted in mind and soul, followed
him. An auto-taxi took them to the Rue Maugrabine.
The desolate and haggard <span class='it'>femme de journée</span> was restoring
the house of death to some sort of aimless
order. Bigourdin put a ten-franc piece into her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is for you. Come back in two hours’ time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman went. The two men were left alone in
the wretched little room, whose poverty stared from
its cracked and faded wall paper, from its bare floor,
from the greasy plush couch with one maimed leg stuck
in an old salmon tin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras threw himself with familiar recklessness
on the latter article of furniture and covered his eyes
with his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A quarter of a century is a long time, my dear
Gaspard,” said he. “A quarter of a century’s daily
and nightly intimate associations with another human
being leaves a deep imprint in one’s soul. I have been
very unhappy, it is true. But I have never been so
unhappy and so hopeless as I am now. Let me be for
a little. My head is stupefied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon pauvre vieux</span>,” said Bigourdin, very gently.
He glanced around and seeing a blanket, which Clothilde
had used during her vigil, neatly folded by the
<span class='it'>femme de Journée</span> and laid upon a wooden chair, he
threw it over the recumbent Fortinbras. “<span class='it'>Mon pauvre
vieux</span>, you are exhausted. Stay there and go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very weary man closed his eyes. Two hours
later, the <span class='it'>femme de journée</span> appeared. Bigourdin,
with his finger to his lips, pointed to the sleeper and
told her to come in the morning. It was then six
o’clock in the afternoon. Bigourdin wrapped in whatever
coverings he could find, dozed in a ricketty armchair
for many hours, until Fortinbras awoke with a
start</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must have fallen asleep,” he said. “I’m very
sorry. What is the time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin pulled out his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Midnight,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras rose, passed both hands over his white
flowing hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I too, like Clothilde, haven’t slept for two or three
nights. Sleep came upon me all of a sudden, let me
see——” he touched his broad forehead—“you brought
me back here for some purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” said Bigourdin. “Come and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the lamp from the table and led his brother-in-law
into the bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you so,” said he, pointing to the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The upper ticking had been ripped clean away. And
there, in the horsehair, on the side where Cécile had
slept, were five or six odd little nests. And each nest
was stuffed tight with banknotes and gold.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all yours,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin, swinging arms like a windmill, swept
imbeciles like Fortinbras to the thirty-two points of the
compass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the property of Cécile. I have nothing to do
with it. I am a man of honour, not a scoundrel. It
belonged to Cécile. It now belongs to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They argued for a long time until sheer hunger
sent them forth. And over supper in a little restaurant
of the quarter, they argued, until at last Bigourdin,
very wearied, retired to the Hôtel de la Dordogne,
and Fortinbras returned to the Rue Maugrabine, to
find himself the unwilling possessor of about two
thousand pounds.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> interest which Félise manifested in Madame
Chauvet’s conversation surprised that simple-minded
lady. Madame Chauvet fully realised
her responsibilities. She performed her dragonly
duties with the conscientiousness of a French mother
who had (and was likely to have to the end of the
chapter) marriageable daughters. But commerce is
commerce, and the young girl engaged in commercial
management in her own house has, in France, owing
to the scope required by her activities, far more freedom
than her school contemporary who leads a purely
domestic life: a fact recognised by the excellent Madame
Chauvet as duly established in the social scheme.
She was ready to allow Félise all the necessary latitude.
Félise claimed scarcely any. She kept the good
Madame Chauvet perpetually pinned to her skirts. She
had not a confidential word to say to Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Madame Chauvet liked Martin, as did every
one in Brantôme. He was courteous, he was modest,
he was sympathetic. Whatever he did was marked
by an air of good-breeding which the French are very
quick to notice. Whether he handed her the stewed
veal or listened to the latest phase of her chronic phlebitis,
Madame Chauvet always felt herself in the presence
of what she termed, <span class='it'>une âme d’élite</span>—a picked and
chosen soul; he was also as gentle as a sheep. Why,
therefore, Félise, in her daily intercourse with Martin,
should insist on her waving the banner of the proprieties
over their heads, was more than the good lady
could understand. Félise was more royalist than the
King, more timid than a nunnery, more white-wax
and rose-leaves than her favourite author, Monsieur
Réné Bazin, had ever dared to portray as human. If
Martin had been six foot of thews and muscles, with
conquering moustaches, and bold and alluring eyes, she
would not have hesitated to protect Félise with her
Frenchwoman’s little plump body and unshakable courage.
But why all this precaution against the mild,
grey-eyed, sallow-faced Martin, <span class='it'>doux comme un mouton</span>?
And why this display of daughterly affection
suddenly awakened after fifteen years’ tepid acquaintance?
Even Martin, unconscious of offence, wondered
at such prim behaviour. The fact remained,
however, that she scarcely spoke to him during the
greater part of Bigourdin’s absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the news came that her mother was dead
and laid to rest, and she had recovered from the first
overwhelming shock, she dropped all outer trappings
of manner and became once more the old Félise. Madame
Chauvet, knowing nothing of the dream-mother,
offered her unintelligent consolation. She turned instinctively
to Martin, in whom she had confided. Martin
was moved by her grief and did his best to sympathise;
but he wished whole-heartedly that Bigourdin
had not told him the embarrassing truth. Here was
the poor girl weeping her eyes out over a dead angel
whom he knew to be nothing of the kind. He upbraided
himself for a sacrilegious hypocrite when he
suggested that they would meet in Heaven. She withdrew,
however, apparently consoled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few hours later, she came to him again—in the
vestibule. She had dried her eyes and she wore the
air of one who has accepted sorrow and bravely faced
an unalterable situation. She showed also a puzzled
little knitting of the brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me truly, Martin,” she said. “Did my uncle,
before he left, give you the real reason of his going
to Paris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Challenged, Martin could not lie. “Yes. Your
mother was very ill. But he commanded me not to
tell you, in order to save you suffering. He didn’t
know. She might recover, in which case all would
have been well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you, too, were dragged into this strange plot,
to keep me away from my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never heard of one, Félise,” answered Martin,
this time with conscience-smiting mendacity, “and my
part has been quite innocent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There has been a plot of some kind,” said Félise,
breaking into the more familiar French. “My uncle,
my father, my Aunt Clothilde have been in it. And
now you—under my uncle’s orders. There has been
a mystery about my mother which I have never been
able to understand—like the mystery of the Trinity or
the Holy Sacraments. And to-day I understand still
less. I have not seen my mother since I was five years
old. She has not written to me for many years, although
I have written regularly. Did she get my letters?
These are questions I have been asking myself
the last few hours. Why did my father not allow me
to see her in the hospital in Paris? Why did my Aunt
Clothilde always turn the mention of her name aside
and would tell me nothing about her? And now,
when she died, why did they not telegraph for me to
go to Paris, so as to look for one last time on her face?
They knew all that was in my heart. What have
they all been hiding from me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor Félise,” said Martin, “how can I tell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And how could he, seeing that he was bound in
honour to keep her in ignorance?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes I think she may have had some dreadful
disease that ravaged her dear features, and they
wished to spare me the knowledge. But my father
has always drawn me the picture of her lying beautiful
as she always was upon the bed she could not leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever it was,” said Martin, “you may be sure
that those who love you acted for the best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all very well for a child; but not for a
grown woman. And it is not as though I have not
shown myself capable of serious responsibilities. It
is heart-rending,” she added after a little pause, “to
look into the eyes of those one loves and see in them
something hidden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting there sideways on the couch by Martin’s side,
her girlish figure bent forward and her hands nervously
clasped on her knee, the oval of her pretty face
lengthened despondently, her dark eyes fixed upon him
in reproachful appeal, she looked at once so pathetic
and so winning that for the moment he forgot the
glory of Lucilla and longed to comfort her. He laid
his hand on her white knuckles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would give anything,” said he——</p>

<p class='pindent'>She loosened her clasp, thus eluding his touch, and
moved a little aside. Madame Chauvet appeared from
the kitchen passage, bearing a steaming cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ma pauvre petite</span>,” she said, “I have brought
you a cup of camomile tea. Drink it. It calms the
nerves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin rose and the good lady took his seat and
discoursed picturesquely upon her mother’s last illness,
death and funeral, until Félise, notwithstanding
the calming properties of the camomile tea, burst into
tears and fled to her room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little girl,” said Madame Chauvet, sympathetically.
“I cried just like that. I remember it as
if it were yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Bigourdin returned. He walked about
expanding his chest with great draughts of air like
the good provincial who had suffocated in the capital.
He railed at the atmosphere, the fever, the cold-heartedness
of Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One is much better here,” said he. “And we have
made much further progress in civilisation. Even the
Hôtel de la Dordogne has not yet a bathroom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was closeted long with Félise, and afterwards
came to Martin, great wrinkles of perturbation marking
his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has been asking me questions which it has
taken all my tact and diplomacy to answer. <span class='it'>Mon Dieu,
que j’ai menti!</span> But I have convinced her that all we
have done with regard to her mother has been right.
I will tell you what I have said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better not,” replied Martin, anxious to
have no more embarrassing confidences; “the less I
know, the simpler it is for me to plead ignorance when
Félise questions me—not to say the more truthful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” said Bigourdin. “<span class='it'>Magna est
veritas et prœvalebit.</span>” And as Martin, not catching
the phrase as pronounced in continental fashion, looked
puzzled, he repeated it. “It’s Latin,” he added. “Why
should I not quote it? I have received a good education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now about this time a gracious imp of meddlesomeness
alighted on Lucilla’s shoulder and whispered into
her ear. She arose from a sea of delicate raiment and
tissue paper whose transference by Céleste into ugly
trunks she and Heliogabalus were idly superintending,
and, sitting down at the writing-desk of her hotel bedroom,
scribbled a short letter. If she had blown the
imp away, as she might easily have done, for such
imps are irresponsible dragon-fly kind of creatures,
Martin might possibly have foregone his consultation
with Fortinbras and remained at Brantôme. Félise
having once restored him to the position he occupied
in her confidence, allowed him to remain there. In
his thoughts she assumed a new significance. He realised,
in his blundering masculine way, that she was
many-sided, complex, mysterious; at one turn, simple
and caressive as a child, at another passionate in her
affections, at yet another calm and self-reliant; altogether
that she had a strangely sweet and strong personality.
For the first time, the alliance so subtly
planned by Bigourdin, entered his head. If Bigourdin
thought him worthy to be his partner and carry on
the historic traditions of the Hôtel des Grottes, surely
he would look with approval on his carrying them on
in conjunction with the most beloved member of his
family. And Félise? There his inexperience came
to a stone wall. He was modest. He did not in the
least assume as a possibility that she might have already
given him her heart. But he reflected that, after
all, in the way of nature, maidens did marry unattractive
and undeserving men; that except for an unaccountable
phase of coldness, she had always bestowed
on him a friendly regard which, if courteously fostered,
might develop into an affection warranting on her part
a marriage with so unattractive and undeserving a man
as himself. And Bigourdin, great, splendid-hearted
fellow, claimed him, and this warm Périgord, this land
of plenty and fat things, claimed him. Here lay his
destiny. Why not blot out, with the blackest curtain
of will, the refulgent figure that was making his life
a torture and a dream?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then came the imp-inspired letter.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>Dear Mr. Overshaw,
I am starting for Egypt to-morrow. I hope you
will redeem your promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With kind regards,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:8em;'>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Lucilla Merriton</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paralysed then were the promptings towards sluggish
plentitude and tepid matrimonial comfort. Love
summoned him to fantastic adventure. For a while
he lost mental balance. He decided to put himself
in the hands of Fortinbras. He would abide loyally
by his decision. Under his auspices he had already made
one successful bid for happiness. By dismissing Margett’s
Universal College to the limbo of irretrievable
things, according to the Dealer’s instructions, had he
not tasted during the past five months hundreds of the
once forbidden delights of life? Was he the same man
who in apologetic trepidation had written to Corinna
in August? His blind faith in Fortinbras was intensified
by knowledge of the suffering whereby the Dealer
in Happiness had acquired wisdom. East or West,
whichever way Fortinbras pointed, he would go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus in some measure he salved his conscience when
he left Brantôme. Bigourdin expected him back at
the end of his fortnight’s holiday. So did Félise. She
packed him a little basket of food and wine, and with
a smile bade him hasten back. She did not question
the purport of his journey. He needed a change, a
peep into the great world of Paris and London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you have a quarter the good time I had, I
envy you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Bigourdin, with a grip of the hand and a
knowing smile, as they parted, whispered: “I will give
that old dress suit to Anatole, the <span class='it'>plongeur</span> at the Café
de l’Univers. He will be enchanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train steamed out of the station carrying a traitorous,
double-dyed villain. It arrived at Paris carrying
a sleepless, anxious-eyed young man throbbing
with suspense. He drove to the Hôtel du Soleil et de
l’Ecosse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Monsieur has returned,” said the fat and
greasy Bocardon as he entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evidently,” replied Martin, who now had no timidities
in the presence of hotel managers and was not
impressed by the professional facial memory. Was he
not himself on the verge of becoming a French innkeeper?
He presented a business card of the Hôtel
des Grottes mysteriously inscribed by Bigourdin, and
demanded a good room. The beady black eyes of the
Provençal regarded him shrewdly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some months ago you were a professor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is always permissible for an honest man to
change his vocation,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is very true,” said Bocardon. “I myself made
my studies as a veterinary surgeon, but as I am one
of those unfortunates whom horses always kick and
dogs always bite, I entered the service of my brother,
Emile Bocardon, who keeps an hotel at Nîmes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Hôtel de la Curatterie,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know it?” cried Bocardon, joyously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not personally. But it is familiar to every <span class='it'>commis-voyageur</span>
in France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His professional knowledge at once gained him the
esteem and confidence of Monsieur Bocardon and a
magnificent chamber at a minimum tariff. After he
had eaten and sent a message to Fortinbras at the
new address given him by Bigourdin, he went out into
the crisp, exhilarating air, with Paris and all the universe
before him.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>In the queer profession into which he had drifted,
Heaven knows how, of giving intimate counsel not
only to the students, but (as his reputation spread) to
the small shopkeepers and work-people of the <span class='it'>rive
gauche</span>, at his invariable fee of five francs per consultation,
Fortinbras had been able to take a detached
view of human problems. In their solution he could
forget the ever frightening problem of his own existence,
and find a subdued delight. Only in the case of
Corinna and Martin had he posed otherwise than as
an impersonal intelligence. As an experiment he had
brought them into touch with his own personal concerns.
And now there was the devil to pay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For consider. Here he was prepared to deal out
advice to Martin according to the conspiracy into
which he had entered with Bigourdin. Martin was to
purchase an interest in the Hôtel des Grottes and (although
he knew it not) marry Félise. There could
not have been a closer family arrangement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Fortinbras rose from the frosty <span class='it'>terrasse</span> of
the Café Cardinal, at the corner of the Rue Richelieu
and the Boulevard des Italiens, their appointed rendezvous,
and greeted Martin, there was something more
than benevolence in his smile, something paternal in
his handshake. They entered the Café-Restaurant
and sat down at one of the tables not yet laid for
<span class='it'>déjeuner</span>, for it was only eleven o’clock. Fortinbras,
attired in his customary black, looked more trim, more
prosperous. Collar, cuffs and tie were of an impeccable
whiteness. The silk hat which he hung with
scrupulous care on the peg against the wall, was startlingly
new. He looked like a disguised cardinal in
easy circumstances. He made bland enquiries as to
the health of the good folks at Brantôme, and ordered
an <span class='it'>apéritif</span> for Martin and black-currant syrup and
water for himself. Then Martin said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come from Brantôme to consult you on a
matter of the utmost importance—to myself, of course.
It’s a question of my whole future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid a five-franc piece on the table. Fortinbras
pushed the coin back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy, this is a family affair. I know all
about it. For you I’m no longer the <span class='it'>Marchand de
Bonheur</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re not,” said Martin, “I don’t know what
the devil I shall do.” And, with his finger, he flicked
the coin midway between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow,” said Fortinbras, flicking the coin
an inch towards Martin, “if you so desire it, I will
deal with you in my professional capacity. But as in
the case of the solicitor or the doctor it would be unprofessional
to accept fees for the settlement of his
own family affairs, so, in this matter, I am unable to
accept a fee from you. Bigourdin, whose character
you have had an intimate opportunity of judging, has
offered you a share in his business. As a lawyer and
a man of the world, I say unhesitatingly, ‘Accept it,’
As long as Brantôme lasts—and there are no signs of
it perishing,—commercial travellers and tourists will
visit it and go to the Hôtel des Grottes. And as long
as European civilisation lasts, it will demand the gastronomic
delicacies of truffles, <span class='it'>pâté de foie gras</span>, Périgord
pie, stuffed quails and compôte of currants which
now find their way from the <span class='it'>fabrique</span> of the hotel to
Calcutta, Moscow, San Francisco, Bayswater and
Buenos Ayres. As a <span class='it'>marchand de bonheur</span>, as you are
pleased to call me, I also unhesitatingly affirm that in
your acceptance you will find true happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sipped his cassis and water, and leaned back
on the plush-covered seat. Martin pushed the five-franc
piece three or four inches towards Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t such a simple, straightforward matter as
you seem to imagine,” said Martin. “Otherwise I
should have closed with Bigourdin’s generous offer
straight away. I’m not a fool. And I’m devotedly
attached to Bigourdin, who, for no reason that I can
see, save his own goodness of heart, has treated me
like a brother. I haven’t come to consult you as a
man of business at all. And as for conscientious
scruples about Bigourdin being a relative of yours,
please put them away.” He pushed the coin another
inch. “It is solely as <span class='it'>marchand de bonheur</span>, in the
greatest crisis of my life, when I’m torn to pieces by
all sorts of conflicting emotions, that I want to consult
you. There are complications you know nothing
about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Complications?” Fortinbras stretched out a benign
hand. “Is it possible that there is some little—what
shall we say?—sentiment?” He smiled, seeing the
young man’s love for Félise barring his candid way.
“You can be frank with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a damned sight more than sentiment,” cried
Martin with unprecedented explosiveness. “Read
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dragged from his pocket a dirty, creased and
crumpled letter and threw it across the table. Fortinbras
adjusted his glasses and read the imp-inspired
message. He took off his glasses and handed back
the letter. His face became impassive and he regarded
Martin with expressionless, tired, blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your promise. What was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To go to Egypt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you go to Egypt to meet Lucille Merriton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin threw up both hands in a wide gesture.
“Can’t you see? I’m mad to go to Egypt, or Cape
Horn, or Hell, to meet her. But I’ve enough sanity
left to come here and consult you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras regarded him fixedly, and nodded his
head reflectively many times; and without taking his
eyes off him, reached out his hand for the five-franc
piece which he slipped into his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That puts,” said he, “an entirely different complexion
on the matter.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> astute conspiracy had tumbled to ruins, the
keystone, Félise, being knocked out. It was no
longer a family affair. Fortinbras listened to
the young man’s statement of his case with professional
detachment. His practised wit questioned.
Martin replied until he had laid bare his candid and
intoxicated soul. At last Fortinbras, with a wave of
his plump hand, and with his benevolent smile, said:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us now adjourn from labour to refreshment.
I will give myself a luxury I have not enjoyed for
many a year. I will entertain a guest. You shall
lunch with me. When our spirits are fortified and our
judgments mellowed by generous food, we shall
adjourn from refreshment to labour. Sometimes you
can put a five-franc piece into the slot and pull out an
opinion. Sometimes you can’t. Let us go to another
table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lunched. Fortinbras talked of men and things
and books. He played the perfect host until the first
cigarette had been smoked. Then he lay back in the
upholstered seat against the wall and looked into
vacancy, his face a mask. Martin, sitting by his side,
dared not disturb him. He felt like one in the awe-inspiring
presence of an oracle. Presently the oracle
stirred, shifted his position and resumed human semblance,
the smile reappearing in his eyes and at the
corners of his pursy mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Martin,” said he, one elbow on the table
and the hand caressing his white hair, “I have now
fully considered the question, and see distinctly your
path to happiness. As my good old friend Montaigne
says—an author I once advised you to cultivate——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done so,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras beamed. “There is none richer in humanity.
In his words, I say ‘The wisdom of my instruction
consists in liberty and naked truth,’ I take
the human soul as it is and seek to strip it free from
shackles and disguises. I strip yours from the shackles
of gross material welfare and the travesty of content.
I see it ardent in the pursuit, perhaps of the unattainable,
but at any rate in the pursuit of splendour, which
is a splendid thing for the soul. Liberty and naked
truth are the only watchwords. Sell out some of your
capital, equip yourself in lordly raiment, go to Egypt
and give your soul a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I needn’t tell you,” said Martin, after a pause,
“that I was hoping you would give me this advice. It
seems all crazy. But still——” he lit a cigarette, which
during Fortinbras’s discourse he had been holding in
his fingers. “Well—there it is. I don’t seem to care a
hang what happens to me afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From my professional point of view,” said Fortinbras,
“that is an ideal state of mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the same, I can’t help feeling a brute. What
the devil can I say to Bigourdin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can leave that to me,” replied Fortinbras.
“He is aware that you are a client of mine and not
only honour me with your confidence, but are willing
to be guided by my counsel. If you will accept my
society, I will accompany you to the Land of the
Pharaohs——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” cried Martin, taken aback. “You? Good
God! Of course,” he added, after recovery, “I should
love you to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I was saying,” Fortinbras continued, “I will
accompany you, take upon my shoulders your responsibilities
with regard to Bigourdin, and, for my own
private satisfaction, realise the dream of my life which
is to go up to the Sphinx and say, ‘Now, my dear
creature, confidentially as between Augur and Augur,
what the deuce is it all about?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, when Martin had accustomed himself to
the amazing proposal, they discussed ways and
means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You,” said Fortinbras, “in order to drink the deep
draughts essential to your evolution, must peacock it
with the best. You must dwell in palaces and drive
in chariots. I, on the other hand, journeying as a
philosopher, need but a palm-tree’s shade, a handful
of dates and a cup of water. I shall therefore not be
of your revellings. But I shall always be near at hand,
a sort of private djinn, always at your distinguished
service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s most delightful and generous of you to put
it that way,” laughed Martin, “but for the life of me
I can’t see why you should do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras replied simply: “I’m a very weary man,
my dear boy, and my heart needs a holiday. That is
why I grasp this opportunity of going into the sunshine.
As to my offer of counsel, that is a matter
which it would be futile to discuss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His last words were flavoured with mystery. As
far as Martin was concerned, Fortinbras was free to
go whithersoever he pleased. But why this solicitude
as to his welfare, this self-made Slave of the Lamp
obligation? Soon he gave up the riddle. Too many
exciting thoughts swept his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until it was written, the letter to Bigourdin weighed
on his mind. The problem confronting him was to
explain his refusal without reference to Lucilla. To
Fortinbras, keeper of his conscience, he could avow
his splendid lunacy and be understood. To Bigourdin
his English reserve forbade his writing himself down
an ass and saying: “The greasy waiter cannot accept
partnership with you, as he must follow to the ends
of the earth the radiant lady to whom he handed the
mutton cutlets.” The more he tried the less could he
do it. He sat up all night over the letter. It contained
all the heart of him that was left for the Hôtel
des Grottes and Brantôme and Périgord; but—well—he
had arranged to abide by Fortinbras’s decision.
Fortinbras had advised him to see more of the world
before definitely settling his life. With a disingenuousness
which stabbed his conscience, he threw the responsibility
on Fortinbras. Fortinbras was carrying
him to Egypt on an attempt to solve the riddle of the
Sphinx. Bigourdin knew the utter faith he had in
Fortinbras. He sent his affectionate regards to everybody—and
to Félise. It was the most dreadful, heart-tearing
letter he had ever had to write.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Fortinbras, betraying, for the first time
in his life, professional secrecy, revealed the whole
matter to Bigourdin in an illuminating document. And
Bigourdin, reading it, and comparing it with Martin’s
letter, said “<span class='it'>Bigre!</span>” and “<span class='it'>Sacrebleu!</span>” and “<span class='it'>Nom de
Dieu de nom de Dieu!</span>” and all sorts of other things.
At first he frowned incredulously. But on every re-perusal
of the letter the frown grew fainter, until, after
the fifth, the placid smile of faith overspread his broad
countenance. But Félise, who was only told that Martin
was not returning but had gone to Egypt with
her father, grew white and thin-lipped, and hated the
day she had met Lucilla Merriton and all the days she
had spent with Lucilla Merriton, and, in a passion of
tears, heaped together everything that Lucilla Merriton
had ever given her, gowns and furs and underlinen
and trinkets, in a big trunk which she stowed
away in an attic. And the <span class='it'>plongeur</span> from the Café de
l’Univers was appointed waiter in Martin’s stead and
strutted about proudly in Martin’s cast-off raiment.
He was perhaps the most care-free person in the
Hôtel des Grottes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went on a flying visit to London, and, on
the advice of Fortinbras, put up at the Savoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Accustom yourself to lordliness,” the latter had
counselled. “You can’t conquer Egypt with the self-effacing
humility of the servitor. By rubbing shoulders
with the wealthy, you will acquire that suspicion
of arrogance—the whiff of garlic in the salad—in
which your present demeanour is so sadly lacking.
You will also learn by observation the correct wear
in socks and ties, and otherwise steep yourself in the
study of indispensable vanities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin studied conscientiously, and when he had
satisfactorily arranged his financial affairs, including
the opening of a banking account with Messrs. Thomas
Cook &amp; Son, visited tailors and haberdashers and hatters
and bootmakers, ordering all the things he had
seen worn by the opulent youth of the Savoy Hotel.
If he had stolen the money to pay for them, or if he
had intended to depart with them without paying, he
could not have experienced a more terrifying joy.
Like a woman clothes-starved for years, who has been
given the run of London shops, Martin ran sartorially
mad. He saw suitings, hosiery, shoes, with Lucilla’s
eye. He bought himself a tie-pin, a thing which he
had never possessed nor dreamed of possessing in
his life before; and, observing that an exquisite young
Lothario upon whom he resolved to model himself did
not appear with the same tie-pin on two consecutive
days, he went out and bought another. Modesty and
instinctive breeding saved him from making himself
a harlequin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of these preoccupations, he called, by
arrangement, on Corinna. She was living with another
girl on the fifth floor of a liftless block of flats
in Wandsworth. The living room held two fairly
comfortably. Three sat at somewhat close quarters.
So when Martin arrived, the third, Corinna’s mate,
after a perfunctory introduction, disappeared into a
sort of cupboard that served her as a bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna looked thin and ill and drawn, and her
blouse gaped at the back, and her fair hair exhibited
the ropiness of neglect. The furniture of the room
was of elementary flimsiness. Loose newspapers,
pamphlets, handbills, made it as untidy as Corinna’s
hair. As soon as they were alone, Martin glanced from
her to her surroundings and then back again to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Corinna,” said he, putting hat, stick and
gloves on a bamboo table, “what on earth are you doing
with yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him defiantly, with a touch of haggardness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am devoting myself to the Cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin wrinkled a puzzled brow. “What cause?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a woman there is only one,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Martin. “May I sit down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She poked a tiny fire in a diminutive tiled grate,
while he selected the most solid of the bamboo chairs.
She sat on a stool on the hearthrug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’re anti-suffrage like any other bigoted
reactionary,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin replied truly: “I haven’t worried about it
one way or the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned on him swiftly. “Then you’re worse
than a downright opponent. It’s just the contemptuous
apathy of men like you that drive us mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She entered upon a long and nervous tirade, trotting
out the old arguments, using the stock phrases,
parroting a hundred platform speeches. And all the
time, though appearing to attack, she was on the defensive,
defiant, desperate. Martin regarded her with
a shocked expression. Her thin blonde beauty was
being pinched into shrewishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear Corinna,” said he. “I’ve come to
see you, as an old friend. I just want to know how
you’re getting on. What’s the good of a political argument
between us two? You may be wrong or you
may be right. I haven’t studied the question. Let us
drop it from a contentious point of view. Let us meet
humanly. Or if you like, let us tell each other the
outside things that have happened to us. You haven’t
even asked me why I’m here. You haven’t asked after
Félise, or Fortinbras, or Bigourdin.” He waxed
warm. “I’ve just come from Brantôme. Surely you
must have some grateful memories of the folks there.
They treated you splendidly. Surely you must still
take some interest in them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna supported herself on an outspread hand on
the hearthrug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me to tell you the truth?” She held
him with her pained blue eyes. “I don’t take an
interest in any damned thing in God’s universe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I smoke?” said Martin. He lit a cigarette,
after having offered her his case which she waved
aside impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is so,” said he, “what in the world is the
meaning of all the stuff you have just been talking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you had the sense to have learned something
about me. How otherwise am I to earn my
living? We’ve gone over the ground a hundred times.
This is a way, anyhow, and it’s exciting. It keeps
one from thinking of anything else. I’ve been to
prison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin gasped, asked her if she had hunger-struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried, but I hadn’t the pluck or the hysteria.
Isabel Banditch can do it.” She lowered her voice
and waved towards her concealed companion. “I
can’t. She believes in the whole thing. The vote will
bring along the millennium. Once we have the power,
men are going to be as good as little cherubs terminating
in wings round their necks. Drink will disappear.
Wives shall be like the fruitful soda-water siphon
on the sideboard, and there will be no more
struggle for existence and no more wars. Oh! the
earth is going to be a devil of a place when we’ve finished
with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you talk like this to Miss Banditch?” asked
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled for the first time, and shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the whole you’re rather a commonplace person,
Martin,” she replied, “but you have one remarkable
quality. You always seem to compel me to tell you
the truth. I don’t know why. Perhaps it is just to
puzzle you and annoy you and hurt you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you want to hurt me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrugged her shoulders, and sat with her hands
clasping her knees. “Well—for one thing, you were
my intimate companion for three months and never
for a single second did you think of making love to
me. For all the impression I made on you I might
have been your austere maiden aunt. Sometimes I’ve
wanted to take you between my teeth and shake you
as a terrier shakes a rat. Instead, like an ass, I’ve told
you the blatant truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s interesting,” said Martin, calmly. “But you
seem to want to hurt everybody—those who don’t fall
in love with you and those who do. You hurt our
poor old Bigourdin and he hasn’t got over it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna looked into the diminutive fire. “I suppose
you think I was a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t believe it matters to you what I think,” said
Martin, his vanity smarting at being lashed for a Joseph
Andrews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t. But you think me a fool all the same.
I’ll go on telling you the truth”—she flashed a glance
at him. “Bigourdin’s a million times too good for me.
I should have led him a beast of a life. He has had
a lucky escape. You can tell him that when you go
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” she said with a start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He repeated his statement and smiled amiably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fed up with being a waiter? I’ve wondered how
long you could stick it. What are you going to do
now? As a polite hostess, I suppose I should have
asked that when you first came into the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did expect something of the sort,” Martin confessed,
“until you declared you didn’t take an interest
in any damned thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they both laughed. Corinna stretched out a
hand. “Forgive me,” she said. “I’ve been standing
nearly all day in front of the tube station, dressed in
a green, mauve and white sandwich-board and selling
newspapers, and I’m dog-tired and miserable. I
would ask you to have some tea, but that would only
bring out Isabel, who would talk our heads off. Why
have you left Brantôme?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told her of Bigourdin’s proposal and of Fortinbras’s
counsel; but he made no reference to the flashing
of the divine Lucilla across his path. Once he
had confessed to her the kiss of the onion-eating damsel
who had married the plumber. She had jested but
understood. His romantic knight-errant passion for
Lucilla was stars above her comprehension. When
he mentioned the fact of the death of Mrs. Fortinbras,
Corinna softened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little Félise! It must have been a great sorrow
to her. I’ll write to her. She’s a dear little girl.”
She paused for a few moments. “Now, look here,
Martin,” she said, seizing a fragile poker and smiting
a black lump of coal the size of a potato, “it strikes
me that as fools we’re very much in the same box.
We’ve both thrown over a feather-bed existence. I’ve
refused to marry Bigourdin and incidentally to run
the Hôtel des Grottes, and you have refused to
run the Hôtel des Grottes and incidentally marry
Félise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was never any question of my marrying
Félise,” cried Martin hotly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She scrambled to her feet and flung an impatient
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You make me tired. Have you a grain of sense
in your head or an ounce of blood in your body?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin also rose. “And you?” he countered. “What
have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither,” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case,” said Martin, gathering up hat, stick
and gloves, “I don’t see why we should continue a futile
conversation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He devoid of sense and blood! He who had probed
the soul of Félise and found there virgin indifference!
He who had flung aside a gross temptation. He
who was consumed with a burning passion for an
incomparable goddess! A chasm thousands of miles
wide yawned between him and Corinna. In the same
box, indeed! He quivered with indignation. She regarded
him curiously, through narrowed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do believe,” she said slowly, “that I’ve knocked
some sparks out of you at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would knock sparks out of a putty dog,”
Martin retorted wrathfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took hat and stick away from him and laid
them on the bamboo table. “Don’t let us quarrel,”
she said more graciously. “Sit down again and
finish your story. You said something about Egypt
and Fortinbras going with you. Why Egypt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose Fortinbras pointed a prophetic finger.
‘There lies the road to happiness.’ But what is he
doing there himself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is going to talk to the Sphinx,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when you’ve spent all your capital in riotous
living, what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know and I don’t care,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s your business, not mine,” said Corinna.
“You’re lucky to be able to get out of this beastly
climate. I wish I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked for a while the generalities of travel.
Then he asked her to dine with him and go to a
theatre. This brought her back to herself. She
couldn’t. She had no time. All her evenings were
taken up with meetings which she had to attend. And
she hadn’t an evening gown fit to wear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would rather die than appear in a blouse and
skirt in the stalls of a theatre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can go to the pit or upper circle,” said Martin,
who had never sat in the stalls in his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she declined. The prodigal in the pit was too
ludicrous. No. She was conscientious. She had
adopted martyrdom as a profession; she was paid for
being a martyr; and to martyrdom, so long as it didn’t
include voluntary starvation, she would stick until
she could find a pleasanter and more lucrative means
of livelihood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very well for you to talk like that,” said
Martin in his sober way, “but how can you call yourself
conscientious when you take these people’s money
without believing in their cause?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you I didn’t believe in it?” she
cried. “Do you know what it means to be an utterly
useless woman? I do. I’m one. It is to prevent
replicas of myself in the next generation that I
get up at a public meeting and bleat out ‘Votes for
Women,’ and get ignominiously chucked. Can’t you
see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Martin. “Your attitude is too Laodicean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” snapped Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s somewhere in the Bible. The Laodiceans were
people who blew both hot and cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father found scriptural terms for me much
more picturesque than that,” said Corinna, with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A door opened and the frozen, blue-nosed head of
Miss Banditch appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry to interrupt you, Corinna, but are we
never going to have tea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna apologised. Tea was prepared. Miss Banditch
talked on the One and Only Topic. Martin listened
politely. During a pause, while he stood offering
a cup for Corinna to fill for the second time, she remarked
casually:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, you met Miss Merriton, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was like a knock on the head. He
nearly dropped the cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Merriton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a friend of mine. I had a note from her at
Christmas to say that she had been to Brantôme and
made your acquaintance, and had carried off Félise to
the south of France. Why haven’t you told me about
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under her calm, smiling gaze he felt himself grow
hot and red and angry. He fenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must remember my position in Brantôme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She poured the milk into his cup. “She said she
was going to Egypt. Sugar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Banditch resumed her argument. The remainder
of the visit was intolerable. As soon as he could
swallow his tea, he took his leave. Corinna followed
him into the tiny passage by the flat-door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear old Martin,” she said, impulsively throwing
an arm round him and gripping his shoulder. “I’m
a beast, and a brute, and I hate everybody and everything
in this infernal world. But I do wish you the
very best of good luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened the door and with both hands thrust
him gently forth; then quickly she closed the door all
but a few inches behind him, and through the slit she
cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give my love to Lucilla!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door banged, and Martin descended the five
flights of stairs, lost in the maze of the Eternal Feminine.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>C</span><span class='sc'>AIRO</span> station. An illumination of livid blue.
A horde of brown-legged turbaned figures
wearing red jerseys on which flaunted in white
the names of hotels, and reconstructing Babel. An
urbane official, lifting a gold-banded cap in the middle
of a small oasis of silence and inviting Martin in the
name of the Semiramis Hotel, to surrender luggage and
all other cares to his keeping, and to follow the stream
through the exit to the hotel motor. A phantasmagoria
of East and West rendered more fantastic by the
shadows cast by the high arc-lamps. He had lost sight
of Fortinbras, who bag in hand—his impedimenta
being of the scantiest—had disappeared in quest of
the palm-tree against whose trunk he presumably was
to pass the night. Martin emerged from the station,
entered the automobile, one of a long row, and waited
with his fellow passengers until the roof was stacked
with luggage. Then the drive through European
streets suggestive of Paris and the sudden halt at the
hotel. A dazzling vision of a lounge, a swift upward
journey in a lift worked by a Nubian gorgeous in scarlet
and gold, a walk down a corridor, a door flung
open, and Martin found himself in his bedroom. An
Arab brought hot water and retired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin opened the shutters of the window and
looked out. It was hard moonlight. Beneath him
shimmered a broad ribbon of water, against which
were silhouetted outlandish masts and spars of craft
moored against the embankment. The dark mass on
the further shore seemed to be pleasant woods. The
water could be nothing else than the Nile; the sacred
river; the first river in which he had taken a romantic
interest, on account of Moses and the Ark and Pharaoh’s
daughter; the mighty river which is the very
life of a vast country; the most famous river in the
world. He regarded it with a curious mixture of awe
and disappointment. On his right it was crossed by
a bridge dotted with the slowly moving lamps of carts
and now and then flashing with the headlights of a
motor-car. It was not unlike any ordinary river—the
Thames, the Seine, the Rhone at Geneva. He had
imagined it broad as the Amazon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it was wonderful; the historic water, the moonlight,
the clear Egyptian air in which floated a vague
perfume of spice, the dimly seen long-robed figures
seated on a bench by the parapet on the other side of
the road, whose guttural talk rose like a proclamation
of the Orient. He leaned out over the iron railing.
On his left stood out dreamily defined against the sky
two shadowy little triangles. He wondered what
they could be. Suddenly came the shock of certainty.
They were the Pyramids. He rubbed his eyes and
looked again. A thrill ran over his skin. He had not
counted on being brought up bang, as it were, against
them. He had imagined that one journeyed for half
a day on a camel through a trackless desert in order
to visit these wonders of the world: but here he was
staring at them from the hotel-window of a luxurious
capital. He stared at them for a long time. Yes:
there was the Nile; there were the Pyramids; and,
after a knock at the door, there was his luggage. He
became conscious of hunger; also of Lucilla more
splendid than moonlit Nile and Pyramids and all the
splendours of Egypt put together. Hunger—it was
half-past nine and he had eaten nothing since lunch
on ship-board—counselled speedy ablutions and a descent
in quest of food. Lucilla ordained correctitude
of vesture. His first evening on board ship had taught
him that dinner jacket suit and black tie were the only
wear. He changed and went downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A chasseur informed him that Miss Merriton was
staying in the hotel, but that she had gone to the dance
at the Savoy. When would she be back? The chasseur,
a child rendered old by accumulated knowledge
of trivial fact, replied that Cairo was very gay this
season, that dances went on till the morning hours, and
insinuated that Miss Merriton was as gay as anybody.
Martin walked through the lounge into the restaurant
and supped. He supped exceedingly well. Bearing
in mind Fortinbras’s counsel of lordliness and the
ways of lordly motorists passing through Brantôme,
he ordered a pint of champagne. He was served by
an impeccable waiter with lilac revers and brass buttons
to his coat. He noted the livery with a professional
eye. The restaurant was comparatively empty.
Only at one table sat a party of correctly dressed men
and women. A few others were occupied by his travelling
companions, still in the garb of travel. Martin
mellowed by the champagne, adjusted his black tie
and preened his white shirt front, in the hope that the
tweed-clad newcomers would see him and marvel and
learn from him, Martin Overshaw, obscure and ignorant
adventurer, what was required by English decorum.
After his meal he sat in the lounge and ordered
Turkish coffee, liqueur brandy and cigarettes.
And so, luxuriously housed, clothed and fed, he entered
on the newest phase of his new life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six months ago he had considered his sportive ride
through France with Corinna a thrilling adventure.
He smiled at his simplicity. An adventure, that tame
jog-trot tour! As comparable to this as his then companion
to the radiant lady of his present quest. Now,
indeed, he had burned his boats, thrown his cap over
the windmills, cast his frock to the nettles. The reckless
folly of it all had kept his veins a-tingle, his head
awhirl. At every moment during the past fortnight
something amazingly new had flashed into his horizon.
The very sleeping-berth in the train de luxe had been
a fresh experience. So too was the awakening to the
warmth and sunshine of Marseilles. Save for a
crowded hour of inglorious life (he was a poor sailor)
now and then on cross-channel boats he had never set
foot on a ship. He wandered about the ocean-going
liner with a child’s delight. Fortune favoured him
with a spell of blue weather. He scoffed at sea-sickness.
The meals characterised by many passengers as
abominable, he devoured as though they were Lucullian
feasts. He made acquaintance with folks going
not only to Egypt, but to Peshawar and Mandalay and
Singapore and other places with haunting names.
Some shocked him by calling them God-forsaken holes
and cursing their luck. Others, mainly women, going
thither for the first time shared his emotions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He
was surprised at the ease with which he fell into casual
talk with strangers. Sometimes a child was a means
of introduction to its mother. Sometimes a woman
in the next deck-chair would open a conversation.
Sometimes Fortinbras chatting with a knot of people
would catch him as he passed and present him blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the minor things that gave him cause for
wonder was the swift popularity of his companion.
No longer did his costume stamp Fortinbras as a man
apart from the laity. He wore the easy tweeds and
soft felt hat of a score of other elderly gentlemen on
board: even the gold watch-chain, which he had redeemed
after a long, long sojourn at the Mount of
Piety. But this very commonplace of his attire brought
into relief the nobility of his appearance. His massive
face lined with care, his broad brow, his prominent
light blue kindly eyes, his pursy and benevolent mouth,
his magnificent Abbé Liszt shock of white hair, now
carefully tended, his impressive air of dignity—all
marked him as a personage of distinction. He aroused
the idle curiosity of the idle voyagers. Husbands were
bidden by wives to talk to him and see what he was
like. Husbands obeyed, as is the human though marriage-vow-subversive
way of husbands, and meekly
returned with information. A capital fellow; most
interesting chap; English of course; very courtly old
bird; like so-and-so who was Ambassador; old school;
knows everything; talks like a book. Quoth any one
of the wives, her woman’s mind intent on the particular.
“But who <span class='it'>is</span> he?” The careless husband, his
masculine mind merely concerned with the general, did
not know. He had not thought of asking. How could
he ask? And what did it matter? The wife sighed.
“Bring him along and I will soon find out.” Fortinbras
at fit opportunity was brought along. The lady
unconsciously surrendered to his spell—one has not
practised as a <span class='it'>marchand de bonheur</span> for nothing.
“Now I know all about him,” said any one of the
wives to any one of the husbands. “Why are men so
stupid? He is an old Winchester boy. He is a retired
philosopher and he lives in France.” That was all
she learned about Fortinbras; but Fortinbras in that
trial interview learned everything about the lady serenely
unconscious of intimate avowal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My young friend,” said he to Martin, “the secret
of social influence is to present yourself to each individual
rather as a sympathetic intelligence, than as a
forceful personality. The patient takes no interest in
the morbid symptoms of his physician: but every patient
is eager to discuss his symptoms with the kindly
physician who will listen to them free, gratis and for
nothing. By adopting this attitude I can evoke from
one the dramatic ambitions of her secret heart, from
another the history of her children’s ailments and the
recipe for the family cough-cure, from a third the moving
story of strained relations with his parents because
he desired to marry his uncle’s typist, the elderly crown
and glory of her sex, and from a fourth an intricate
account of a peculiarly shady deal in lard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds all right,” said Martin; “but in order
to get people to talk to you—say in the four cases you
have mentioned, you must know something about the
theatre, bronchitis, love and the lard-trade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said Fortinbras, touching the young man’s shoulder:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The experienced altruist with an eye to his own
advantage knows something about everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, following the precepts of his Mentor, practised
the arts of fence, parrying the thrusts of personal
questions on the part of his opponent and riposting
with such questions on his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is necessary,” said the sage. “What are you
among these respectable Britons of substance, but an
adventurer? Put yourself at the mercy of one of these
old warriors with grey motor-veils and steel knitting
needles and she will pluck out the heart of your mystery
in a jiffy and throw it on the deck for all to feed
on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the voyage—incidentally was it not to Cythæra?—transcended
all his dreams of social amenity.
It was a long protracted party in which he lost his
shyness, finding frank welcome on all sides. To the
man of thirty who had been deprived, all his man’s
life, of the commonplace general intercourse with his
kind, this daily talk with a girl here, a young married
woman there, an old lady somewhere else, and all
sorts and conditions of men in the smoking room and
on deck, was nothing less than a kind of social debauch,
intoxicating him, keeping him blissfully awake of
nights in his upper berth, while Fortinbras snored below.
Then soon after daybreak, to mount to the wet,
sunlit deck after his cold, sea-water bath; perhaps to
meet a hardy and healthy English girl, fresh as the
Ægean morning; to tramp up and down with her for
development of appetite, talking of nothing but the
glitter of the sea, the stuffiness of cabins, the dishes
they each would choose for breakfast; to descend into
the warm, comforting smell of the dining-saloon; to
fall voraciously on porridge and eggs and kidneys and
marmalade; to go on deck again knowing that in a
couple of hours’ time stewards would come to him
fainting from hunger with bowls of chicken broth,
that in an hour or two afterwards there would be
lunch to be selected from a menu a foot long in close
print, and so on during the golden and esurient day;
to meet Fortinbras, late and luxurious riser; to bask
for an hour, like a plum, in the sunshine of his wisdom;
to continue the debauch of the day before; to
sight great sailing vessels with bellying canvas, resplendent
majesty of past centuries, or, on the other
hand, the grey grim blocks of battleships; to pass the
sloping shores of historic islands—Crete, home of the
Minotaur, whose inhabitants—(Cretans are liars. Cretans
are men. Therefore all men are liars)—had furnished
the stock example of fallacy in the Syllogism;
to watch the green wake cleaving the dark-blue sea;
to make his way up and down decks, through the steerage,
and stand in the bows, swept by the exhilarating
air, with the pulse racking sense that he was speeding
to the lodestar of his one desire—to find wildness
of delight in these commonplaces of travel; to live as
he lived, to vibrate as he vibrated with every nerve
from dawn to dawn, to be drunk with the sheer
ecstasy of existence, so that the past becomes a black
abyss, and the future an amethystine haze glorified by
the Sons of the Morning singing for joy, is given but
to few, is given to none but poor, starved souls, is
given to none of the poor, starved souls but those
whom the high Gods in obedience to their throw of
the dice happen to select.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin sitting in a deep armchair in the Semiramis
Hotel dreamed of all these things, unconscious of the
flight of time. Suddenly he became aware that he was
the only occupant of the lounge, all the other folk having
returned soberly to their rooms. Already a few
early arrivals from the Savoy dance passed across
the outer hall on their way to the lift. Drowsy with
happiness he went to bed. To-morrow, Lucilla.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>He became aware of her standing by the bureau licking
a stamp to put on a letter. She wore a white coat
and skirt and a straw hat with cherries on it. He could
not see her face, but he guessed the blue veins on the
uplifted, ungloved hand that held the stamp. On his
approach, she turned and uttered a little laughing gasp
of recognition, stuck the stamp on hastily and stretched
out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” she cried, “it’s you! You really have
come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you think I would break my promise?” he
asked, his eyes drinking in her beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know how seriously you regarded it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve thought of nothing but Egypt, since I said
you had pointed out the way,” he replied. “You commanded.
I obeyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught up her long parasol and gloves that lay
on the ledge of the bureau. “If everybody did everything
I told them,” she laughed, “I should have my
hands full. They don’t, as a general rule, but when
they do I take it as a compliment. It makes me feel
good to see you. When did you come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put him through a short catechism. What boat?
What kind of voyage? Where was he staying? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Finally:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know many people in Cairo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a soul,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With both arms behind her back, she rested lightly
on the parasol, and beamed graciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know millions,” she said, not without a touch of
exaggeration which pleased him. “Would you like to
trust yourself to me, put yourself entirely in my
hands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could dream of nothing more enchanting,” replied
Martin. “But——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to make myself an infliction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to be a delight. You know in the
cinematograph how an invisible pencil writes things
on the sheet—or how a message is stamped out on the
tape, and you look and wonder what’s coming next.
Well, I want to see how this country is going to be
stamped letter by letter on your virgin mind. It’s a
thing I’ve been longing for—to show somebody with
sense like yourself, Egypt of the Pharaohs and Egypt
of the English. How long can you stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indefinitely,” said Martin. “I have no plans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From here you might go to Honolulu or Rangoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or Greenland or Cape Horn,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded smiling approval. “That is what I call
a free and enlightened Citizen of the World. Let us
sit down. I’m waiting for my friend, Mrs. Dangerfield
of Philadelphia. Her husband’s here too. You
will like them. I generally travel round with somebody,
just for the sake of a table-companion. I’m
silly enough to feel a fool eating alone every day in a
restaurant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew a wicker chair for her and sat beside her.
She deposited parasol and gloves on the little round
table, and swept him with a quizzical glance from his
well-fitting brown shoes to his trim black hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I without impertinence compliment you on
your colour-scheme?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His olive cheek flushed like a girl’s. He had devoted
an hour’s concentrated thought to it before he
rose. How should he appear in the presence of the
divinity? He had decided on grey flannels, grey shirt,
purple socks and tie. He wondered whether she
guessed the part she had played in his anxious selection.
Remembering the splotch of grease, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hadn’t much choice of clothes when you last saw
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “Tell me all about Brantôme. How
is my dear little friend Félise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave her discreet news. “And the incomparable
Fortinbras?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll doubtless soon be able to judge for yourself.
He’s here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Cairo? You don’t say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mingled with her expression of surprise was a little
perplexity of the brow, as though, seeing the Fortinbras
of the Petit Cornichon, she wondered what on
earth she could do with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He came with me,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he staying in this hotel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brow grew smooth again. “How did he manage
to get all this way? Has he retired from business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so. He needed a holiday. You see
he came into a little money on the death of his wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His wife dead?” Lucilla queried. “Félise’s mother?
I didn’t know. Perhaps that’s why she hasn’t written
to me for such a long time. I think there must be
some queer story connected with that mother,” she
added shrewdly. “Anyway, Fortinbras can’t be
broken-hearted, or he wouldn’t come on a jaunt to
Egypt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Too well-bred to examine Martin on his friend’s
private affairs, she changed the talk in her quick, imperious
way. Martin sat like a man bewitched, fascinated
by her remembered beauties—the lazy music of
her voice, her mobile lips, her brown eyelashes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
His heart beat at the realisation of so many dreams.
He listened, his brain scarcely following what she
said; that she spoke with the tongue of an angel was
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently a stout, pleasant-faced woman of thirty
came towards them with many apologies for lateness.
This was Mrs. Dangerfield. Lucilla presented Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold in me the complete dragoman. Mr. Overshaw
has engaged me for the season. It’s his first
visit to Egypt and I’m going to show him round.
I’ll draw up a programme for a personally conducted
tour, every hour accounted for and replete with distraction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds dreadful,” laughed Mrs. Dangerfield.
“Do you think you’ll survive, Mr. Overshaw?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not only that,” said Martin, “but I hope for a new
lease of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We start,” said Lucilla, “with a drive through the
town, during which I shall point out the Kasr-el-Nil
Barracks, the Bank of Egypt and the Opera House.
Then we shall enter on the shopping expedition in
the Mousky, where I shall prevent Mrs. Dangerfield
from being robbed while bargaining for Persian lacq.
I’m ready, Laura, if you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led the way out. Martin exchanging words of
commonplace with Mrs. Dangerfield, followed in an
ecstasy. Did ever woman, outside Botticelli’s <span class='it'>Primavera</span>,
walk with such lissomeness? A chasseur turned
the four-flanged doors and they emerged into the
clear morning sunshine. The old bearded Arab carriage
porter called an hotel <span class='it'>arabeah</span> from the stand.
But while the driver, correct in metal-buttoned livery
coat and tarbush, was dashing up with his pair, Martin
caught sight of Fortinbras walking towards them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There he is,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fortinbras.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” said Lucilla. “That’s an English Cabinet
Minister, or an American millionaire, or the keeper
of a gambling saloon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he came nearer, she admitted it was Fortinbras.
She waved her hand in recognition. Nothing
could have been more charming than her greeting;
nothing more urbane than his acknowledgment, or his
bow, on introduction to Mrs. Dangerfield. He had
come, said he, to lay his respectful homage at her
feet; also to see how his young friend was faring in
a strange land. Lucilla asked him where he was staying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When last I saw you,” he answered, “I said something
about the perch of the old vulture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She eyed him, smiling: “You look more like the
wanton lapwing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case I need even a smaller perch, the merest
twig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ‘Merest Twig, Cairo,’ isn’t an address,” cried
Lucilla. “How am I to get hold of you when I want
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras regarded her with humorous benevolence.
The question was characteristic. He knew her to be
generous, warm-hearted and impatient of trivial convention:
therefore he had not hesitated to go to her in
his anxious hour; but he also knew how those long
delicate fingers had an irresistible habit of drawing
unwary humans into her harmless web. He had not
come to Cairo just to walk into Lucilla’s parlour. He
wanted to buzz about Egypt in philosophic and economical
independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, my dear Lucilla,” said he, “is one more
enigma to be put to the credit of the Land of Riddles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ibrahim stood impassively holding open the door
of the <span class='it'>arabeah</span>. A couple of dragomen in resplendent
robes and turbans, seeing a new and prosperous English
tourist, had risen from their bench on the other
side of the road and lounged gracefully forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the most exasperating person I ever met,”
exclaimed Lucilla. “But while I have you, I’m going
to keep you. Come to lunch at one-fifteen. If you
don’t I’ll never speak to you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come to lunch at one-fifteen, with very great
pleasure,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies entered the carriage. Martin said
hastily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gave me the slip last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” said Fortinbras. He drew the young man
a pace aside, and whispered: “You think those are
doves harnessed to the chariot. They’re not. They’re
horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin broke away with a laugh, and sprang to
the back seat of the carriage. It drove off. The
dragoman came up to the lonely Fortinbras. Did he
want a guide? The Citadel, the Pyramids, Sakkara?
Fortinbras turned to the impassive Ibrahim and in his
grand manner and with impressive gesture said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell them they are too beautiful. They
would eclipse the splendour of all the monuments I
am here to visit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked away and Ibrahim, translating roughly
to the dragomen, conveyed uncomplimentary references
to the virtue of their grandmothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Martin, in beatitude, sat on the little
seat, facing his goddess. She was an integral part of
the exotic setting of Cairo. It was less real life than
an Arabian Night’s tale. She was interfused with all
the sunshine and colour and wonder. Only the camels
padding along in single file, their bodies half hidden
beneath packs of coarse grass, seemed alien to her.
They held up their heads, as the carriage passed them,
with a damnably supercilious air. One of them
seemed to catch his eye and express contempt unfathomable.
He shook a fist at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate those brutes,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious! Why?” asked Lucilla. “They’re
so picturesque! A camel is the one thing I really can
draw properly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I dislike them intensely,” said he. “They’re
inhuman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not translate his unformulated thought
into conventional words. But he knew that at the
summons of the high gods all the world of animate
beings would fall down and worship her: every breathing
thing but the camel. He hated the camel.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>L</span><span class='sc'>UCILLA</span> kept her word. She was not a woman
of half measures. Just as she had set out, impelled
by altruistic fancy, to carry provincial
little Félise through part of a Riviera season, and had
thoroughly accomplished her object, so now she devoted
herself whole-heartedly to the guidance of Martin
through the Land of Egypt. In doing so she was
conscious of helping the world along. Hitherto it
was impeded in its progress by a mild, scholarly gentleman
wasting his potentialities in handing soup to
commercial travellers. These potentialities she had decided
to develop, so that in due season a new force
might be evolved which could give the old world a
shove. To express her motives in less universal terms,
she set herself the holiday task of making a man of
him. To herself she avowed her entire disinterestedness.
She had often thought of adopting and training
a child; but that would take a prodigiously long
time, and the child might complicate her future life.
On the other hand, with grown men and women, things
went more quickly. You could see the grass grow.
The swifter process appealed to her temperament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First she incorporated him, without chance of escape,
in her own little coterie, the Dangerfields, and
the Watney-Holcombes, father, mother and daughter,
Americans who lived in Paris. They received him
guaranteed by Lucilla as an Englishman without guile,
with democratic American frankness. Of Mr. Dangerfield,
a grim-featured banker, possessing a dry, subrident
humour, Martin was somewhat afraid. But
with the Watney-Holcombes, cheery, pleasure-loving
folk, he was soon at his ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only thing you mustn’t do,” said Lucilla, “is
to fall in love with Maisie”—Maisie was a slip of
a girl of nineteen, whom he regarded as an amusing
and precocious child—“There is already a young man
floating about in the smoke of St. Louis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an opportunity to make romantic repudiation,
to proclaim the faith by which he lived. But he had
not yet the courage. He laughed, and declared that
the smoky young man might sleep peacefully of nights.
The damsel herself took him as a new toy and played
with him harmlessly and, subtly inspired by Lucilla,
commanded her father, a chubby, innocent man, with
a face like a red, gold-spectacled apple, to bring Martin
from remote meal solitude and establish him permanently
at their table. Thus, Martin being an accepted
member of a joyous company, could go here, there and
everywhere with any one of them without furnishing
cause for gossip. Lucilla had a deft way of not putting
herself in the wrong with a censorious though
charming world. Under the nominal auspices of the
Dangerfields and the Watney-Holcombes, Martin
mingled with the best of Cairo society. He attended
race-meetings, golf-club teas, hotel balls and merry
little suppers. He went to a reception at the Agency
and shook hands with the great English ruler of
Egypt. He was swept away in automobiles to Helouan
and Heliopolis, to the Mena House to see the Pyramids
and the Sphinx both by daylight and by moonlight. A
young soldier discovering a bond in knowledge of
love of France invited him to Mess on a guest night.
Lucilla, ever watchful and tactful, saw that he went
in full dress, white tie and white waistcoat, and not
in dinner jacket. She pervaded his atmosphere, teaching
him, training him, opening up new vistas for his
mind and soul. Every encomium passed on him she
accepted as a tribute to herself. It was infinitely more
interesting than training a dog or a horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, blissfully unaware of experiment, or even
of guidance, lived in a dream of delight. His goddess
seemed ever ready to hand. Together they visited
mosques and spent enchanted hours in the Bazaar.
She knew her way about the labyrinth, could even
speak a few words of Arabic. Supreme fair product
of the West she stood divinely pure amid the swarthy
vividness of the unalterable East. She was a flawless
jewel in the barbaric setting of those narrow
streets, filled with guttural noise, outlandish bustle
of camels and donkeys and white-clad men, smells of
hoary spiciness, colour from the tattered child’s purple
and scarlet to the yellow of the cinnamon pounded at
doorways in the three-foot mortars; those streets winding
in short joints, each given up to its particular industry—copper
beaters, brass-workers, leather-sellers,
workers in cedar and mother-of-pearl, sellers of cakes
and kabobs, all plying their trades in the frontless
caves that served as shops; streets so narrow and sunless
that one could see but a slit of blue above the latticed
fronts of the crazy houses. He loved to see her
deal with the supple Orientals. In bargaining she did
not haggle; with smiling majesty she paid into the
long slender palm a third, or a half or two-thirds of
the price demanded, according to her infallible sense
of values, and walked away serene possessor of the
merchandise. Lucilla, having a facile memory, had
not boasted in vain that she could play dragoman. He
found from the books that her archæological information
was correct; he drank in her wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For his benefit she ordained a general expedition to
Sakkara. One golden day the party took train to
Badrashen, whence, on donkeys, they plunged into the
desert. Riding in front with him, she was his for most
of that golden day; she discoursed on the colossal
statue, stretched by the wayside, of Rameses II, on the
step pyramid, on the beauties of the little tombs of
Thi and Ptah-hetep, whose sculptures and paintings
of the Vth Dynasty were alive, proceeding direct from
the soul of the artist and thus crying shame on the
conventional imitations of a thousand or two years
later with which most of the great monuments of
Egypt are adorned. And all she said was Holy Writ.
And at Mariette’s House where they lunched—the
bungalow pitched in the middle of the baking desert
and overlooking the crumbling brown masses of
tombs—he glanced around at their picnicking companions
and marvelled at her grace in eating a hard-boiled
egg. It was a noisy, excited party and it was
“Lucilla this,” and “Lucilla that,” all the time, for
there was hot argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t take any stock in bulls, so I’m not going
to see the Serapeum,” declared Miss Watney-Holcombe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Lucilla says you’ve got to,” exclaimed Martin.
Then he realised that unconsciously he had used her
Christian name. He flushed and under cover of the
talk turned to her with an apology. He met laughing
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scrubby little artists in Paris call me Lucilla without
the quiver of an eyelash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What may be permissible to a scrubby little artist
in Paris,” said Martin, “mayn’t be permitted to one
who ought to know better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She passed him a plate containing the last banana.
He declined with a courteous gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin,” she said, deliberately dumping the fruit
in front of him, “if you don’t look out, you will die
of conscientiousness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During part of the blazing ride back to Badrashen
when the accidents of route and the vagrom whimsies
of donkeys brought him to the side of the dry Mr.
Dangerfield, he reflected on the attitude of men admitted
to the intimacy of goddesses and great queens.
What did Leicester call the august Elizabeth when she
deigned to lay aside her majesty? And what were the
sensations of Anchises, father of pious Æneas, when
he first addressed Venus by her <span class='it'>petit nom</span>?</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Fortinbras, the next day, “and how is
my speculator in happiness getting on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were sitting on the terrace of Shepheard’s Hotel,
their usual midday meeting-place. Save on these
occasions the philosopher seemed to live dimly, in a
sort of Oriental twilight. Yet all that Martin had
seen (with the exception of the social moving-picture)
he had also seen and therefrom sucked vastly more
juice than the younger man. How and in what company
he had visited the various monuments he did not
say. It amused him to maintain his mysterious independence.
Very rarely, and only when compelled by
the imperious ruthlessness of Lucilla, did he otherwise
emerge from his obscurity than on these daily
visits to the famous terrace. There surrounded by
chatter in all tongues and by representatives of all
cities from Seattle round the earth’s girth to Tokio,
he loved to sit and watch the ever-shifting scene—the
traffic of all the centuries in the narrow street,
from the laden ass driven by a replica of one of Joseph’s
brethren to the modern Rolls-Royce sweeping
along with a fat and tarbushed dignitary of the court;
the ox-cart omnibus carrying its dingy load of veiled
women; the poor funeral procession, the coffin borne
on shoulders amid the perfunctory ululations of hired
mourners; on the footpaths the contrast of slave attended,
black-robed, trim-shod Egyptian ladies in
yashmaks and the frank summer-clad Western women;
Soudanese and Turks and Greeks and Jews and
straight, clear-eyed English officers, and German tourists
attired for the wilds of the Zambesi; and here and
there a Gordon Highlander swinging along in kilts and
white tunic; and lounging against the terrace balustrade,
the dragomen, flaunting villains gay in rainbow
robes, and the vendors of beads and fly-whisks and
postcards holding up their wares at arm’s height and
regarding prospective purchasers with the eyes of a
crumb-expectant though self-respecting dog who sits
on his tail by his master’s side; and, across the way,
the curio shops rich with the spoils of Samarcand.
From all this when alone he garnered the harvest of
a quiet eye. When Martin was with him, he shared
with his pupil the golden grain of the panorama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How,” said he, “is my speculator in happiness getting
on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stock is booming,” replied Martin with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an education,” said Fortinbras, “is the society
of American men of substance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It pleases you to be ironical,” said Martin, “but you
speak literal truth. An American doesn’t set a man
down as a damned fool because he is ignorant of his
own particular line of business. Dangerfield, for instance,
who keeps a working balance of his soul locked
up in a safe in Wall Street, has explained to me the
New York Stock Exchange with the most courteous
simplicity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in return,” said Fortinbras, waving away a
seller of rhinoceros-horn amber, with the gesture of
a monarch dismissing his chamberlain, “you have
given him an exhaustive criticism, not untempered
with jaundice, of lower middle-class education in England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, how the deuce,” said Martin, recklessly
throwing his half-finished cigarette over the balustrade—“How
the deuce did you know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est mon secret</span>,” replied Fortinbras. “It is also
the secret of a dry and successful man like Mr. Dangerfield,
with whom I am sorry to have had no
more than ten minutes’ conversation. In those ten
minutes I discovered in him a lamentable ignorance
of the works of Chaucer, Cervantes and Tourguenieff,
but for my benefit he sized up in a few clattering epigrams
the essence of the Anglo-Saxon, Spanish and
Sclavonic races, and, for his own, was extracting
from me all I know about Tolstoi, when Lucilla called
me away to expound to his wife the French family
system. From which you will observe that the American
believes in a free exchange of knowledge as a
system of education. To revert to my original question,
however, you imagine that your present path is
strewn with roses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all I desire to know, my dear fellow,” said
Fortinbras benevolently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about yourself?” asked Martin. “What
about your pursuit of happiness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am studying Arabic,” replied Fortinbras, “and
discussing philosophy with one Abu Mohammed, a
very learned Doctor of Theology, with a very long
white beard, from whose sedative companionship I
derive much spiritual anodyne.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after this the whole Semiramis party packed
up their traps and went by night train to Luxor.
There they settled down for a while and did the
things that the floating population of Luxor do. They
rode on donkeys and on camels and they drove in
carriages and sand-carts. They visited the Tombs of
the Kings and the Tombs of the Queens, and the
Tombs of the Ministers and Karnak and their own
private and particular Temple of Luxor. And Martin
amassed a vast amount of erudition and learned
to know gods and goddesses by their attitudes and
talked about them with casual intimacy. His nature
drank in all that there was of wonder and charm
in these relics of a colossal past like an insatiable
sponge; and in Upper Egypt the humble present is
but a relic of the past. The twentieth-century fellaheen
guiding the ox-drawn wooden plough might
have served for models of any bas-relief or painting
in any tomb of thousands of years ago. So too might
the half-naked men in the series of terraced trenches
draining water from the Nile by means of rude
wooden lever and bucket to irrigate the land. The
low mud houses of the villages were the same as
those which covering vast expanses on either side of
the river made up the mighty and populous city of
Thebes. And the peasantry purer in type than the
population of Cairo, which till then was all the Egypt
that Martin knew, were of the same race as those
warriors who gained vain victories for unsympathetic
Kings.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The ridgy, rocky, sandy desert, startlingly yellow
against the near-blue dome of sky. A group of donkeys,
donkey-boys, violently clad dragomen, one or
two black-robed, white-turbaned official guides, Europeans
as exotic to the scene as Esquimaux in Hyde
Park. An excavated descent to a hole surmounted by
a signboard as though it were the entrance to some
underground boozing-ken, an Egyptian soldier in
khaki and red tarbush. An inclined plane, then flight
after flight of wooden steps through painted chamber
after painted chamber, and at last, deep down in
the earth, lit by electric light, the heart of the tomb’s
poor mystery: the mummified body of a great King,
Amen-Hetep II, in an uncovered sandstone sarcophagus.
It is the world’s greatest monument to the
awful and futile vanity of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God,” said Martin, as he came out with Lucilla
into the open air. “Thank God for the great
world and sunshine and life. The whole thing is fascinating,
is soul-racking, but I hate these people who
lived for nothing but death. I wanted to bash that
King’s face in. There was that poor devil of an
artist who spent his soul over those sculptures, going
at them hammer and chisel in the black bowels of
the earth with nothing but an oil-lamp on the scaffold
beside him, for years and years—and when he had
finished, calmly put to death by that brute lying there,
so that he should not glorify any other swollen-headed
worm of a tyrant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down on the sand in a triangular patch of
shade. Lucilla regarded him with approbation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love to hear you talk vehemently,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s because I have learned to feel vehemently,”
said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since when?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since I first met you,” said Martin, with sudden
daring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not my example you’ve been profiting by,” she
laughed. “You’ve never heard me raving at a poor
old mummy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cool and casual, she warded off the shaft of his
implied declaration. He had not another weapon to
hand. He said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve said things equally violent when you have
felt deeply. That is your great power. You live
intensely. Everything you do you put your whole self
into. You have the faculty of making everybody
around you do the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment Mr. Watney-Holcombe appeared at
the mouth of the tomb, mopping his rubicund face.
At Lucilla he shook a playful fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not another darned monument for me this day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t seem to have succeeded with him, anyway,”
she said in a low and ironical voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, gentlest of creatures, felt towards Mr.
Watney-Holcombe for the moment as he had felt towards
Amen-Hetep. The rosy-faced gentleman sat
beside them and talked flippantly of gods and goddesses;
and soon the rest of the party joined them.
The opportunity for which Martin had waited so long,
of which he had dreamed the extravagant dreams of
an imaginative child, was gone. He would have to
wait yet further. But he had spoken as he had never
before dared to speak. He had told her unmistakably
that she had taught him to feel and to live. As
the other ladies approached he sprang to his feet and
held out a hand to aid the divinity to rise. She accepted
it frankly, nodded him pleasant thanks. The
pressure of her little moist palm kept him a-tingle for
long afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had a gay and intimate ride home. The donkey
boys thwacked the donkeys so that they galloped
to the shattering of sustained conversation between
the riders. But in one breathing space, while they
jogged along side by side, she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I have done anything to help you on your
way, I regard it as a privilege.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve done everything for me,” said Martin.
“To whom else but you do I owe all this?” His gesture
embraced earth and sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only made a suggestion,” said Lucilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve done infinitely more. Anybody giving advice
could say: ‘Go to Egypt.’ You said, ‘Come to
Egypt,’ and therein lies all the difference. You have
given me of yourself, so bountifully, so generously——”
He paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” she said. “I love to hear you talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the donkey-boys perceiving Mr. Dangerfield
mounted on a fleet quadruped about to break through
the advance guard, thwacked the donkeys again, and
Martin, unless he shouted breathlessly, could not go
on talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening there was a dance at the Winter Palace
Hotel, where they were staying. Martin, on his
arrival at Cairo, had been as ignorant of dancing as
a giraffe; but Lucilla, Mrs. Dangerfield and Maisie
having commandeered the Watney-Holcombe’s private
sitting room at the Semiramis whenever it suited
them, had put him through a severe and summary
course. He threw himself devotedly into the new
delight. A lithe figure and a quick ear aided him.
Before he left Cairo he could dance one-steps and
two-steps with the best; and so a new joy was added
to his existence. And to him it was a joy infinitely
more sensuous and magnetic than to those who from
childhood have regarded dancing as a commonplace
social pleasure. To understand, you must put yourself
in the place of this undeveloped, finely tempered
man of thirty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His arm was around the beloved body, his hand
clasped hers, the fragrance of her hair was in his
nostrils, their limbs moved in perfect unison with the
gay tune. His heart sang to the music, his feet were
winged with laughter. In young enjoyment, she said
with literal truthfulness:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a born dancer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glowed and murmured glad incoherencies of
acknowledgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a born all sorts of other things, I believe,”
she said, “that only need bringing out. You have a
rhythmical soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What she meant precisely she did not know, but it
sounded mighty fine in Martin’s ears. Ever since his
first interview with Fortinbras he had been curiously
interested in that vague organ and its evolution. Now
it was rhythmical. To explain herself she added: “It
is in harmony with the great laws of existence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new light shone in his eyes and he held himself
proudly. He looked quite a gallant fellow, straight,
English, masterful. Her skirts swished the feet of a
couple of elderly English ladies sitting by the wall.
Her quick woman’s ears caught the remark: “What
a handsome couple.” She flushed and her eyes
sparkled into his. He replied to her psychological
dictum:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate it’s in harmony with the deepest of
them all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fundamental law,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They danced the gay dance to the end. They
stopped breathless, and laughed into each other’s eyes.
She took his arm and they left the ball-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless you will dance with me again,” he said,
“this is my last dance to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I leave you to guess,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was as near perfection as could be,” she admitted.
“I feel rather like that myself. Perhaps
more so; for I don’t want to spoil things even by
dancing with you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you really mean it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded frankly, intimately, deliciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go outside, away from everybody,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crossed the lounge and reached the Western
door. Both were living a little above themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When last we talked sense,” she said, “you spoke
about a fundamental law. Come and expound it to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood on the terrace amid other flushed and
happy dancers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us get away from these people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who know nothing of the fundamental law,” said
Lucilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they went along a spur of the terrace, a sort of
rococo bastion guarding the entrance to the hotel, and
there they found solitude. They sat beneath the velvet,
star-hung sky. Fifty yards away flowed the Nile,
with now and then a flashing ripple. From a ghyassa
with ghostly white sail creeping down the river came
an Arab chant. The flowers of the bougainvillea on
the hotel porch gleamed dim and pale. A touch of
khamsin gave languor to the air. Lucilla drew off
her gloves, bade him put them down for her. He
preferred to keep them warm and fragrant, a part of
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now about this fundamental law,” she said in her
lazy contralto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand hung carelessly, temptingly over the arm
of her chair. Graciously she allowed him to take and
hold it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to tell me, Mr. Philosopher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dallied with the adorable situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since when have I become Master and you Pupil,
Lucilla?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you began, presumably to plunge deep into
profundities of wisdom where I can’t follow you. Behold
me at your feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved his chair close to hers and she allowed
him to play with her slender fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fundamental law of life,” said he, bending
towards her, “is love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder!” said Lucilla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lay in the long chair, her head against the
back. He drew her fingers to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure of it. I’m sure of it as I’m sure that
there’s a God in Heaven, as that,” he whispered, in
what the sophisticated may term an anti-climax,
“there’s a goddess on earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is the goddess?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like being called a goddess,” she said, “especially
after dancing the two-step. Hymns Ancient and
Modern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what is the most ancient hymn in
the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I tell you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I not here to be instructed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are beautiful and I love you. You are wonderful
and I love you. You are adorable and I love
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you learn to become so lyrical?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin knew not. He was embarked on the highest
adventure of his life. A super-Martin seemed to speak.
Her tone was playful, not ironical. It encouraged him
to flights more lyrical still. In the daylight of reason
what he said was amazing nonsense. Beneath the
Egyptian stars, in the atmosphere drowsy with the
scents of the East and the touch of khamsin it sounded
to receptive ears beautifully romantic. Through the
open door came the strains of an old-fashioned waltz,
perhaps meretricious, but in the exotic surroundings
sensuous and throbbing with passion. He bent over
her and now possessed both hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that I feel for you, all that you are to me,”
he said, concluding his rhapsody. Then, as she made
no reply, he asked: “You aren’t angry with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not a granite sphinx,” she said, in her low
voice. “No one has ever said things like that to me
before. I don’t say men haven’t tried. They have;
but they’ve always made themselves ridiculous. I’ve
always wanted to laugh at them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said Martin: “You are not laughing at me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she whispered. And after a long pause:
“No, I am not laughing at you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her face to him. Her lips were very
near. Mortal man could have done neither more nor
less than that which Martin did. He kissed her. Then
he drew back shaken to the roots of his being. She
with closed eyes; he saw the rise and fall of her
bosom. The universe, earth and stars and the living
bit of the cosmos that was he, hung in breathless suspense.
Time stopped. There was no space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was holding her beloved hands so delicately and
adorably veined: before his eyes, in the dim light, were
her lips, slightly parted, which he had just kissed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she stirred, withdrew her hands, passed
them across her eyes and with dainty touches about
her hair, as she sat up. Time went on and there was
space again and the stars followed their courses. Martin
threw an arm round her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucilla,” he cried quiveringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with a quick movement she eluded his embrace
and rose to her feet. She kept him off with a little
gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Martin. There has been enough foolishness
for one night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martin, man at last, caught her and crushed her
to him with all his young strength and kissed her, not
as worshipper kisses goddess, but as a man kisses
a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last she said, like millions of her sisters in
similar circumstances: “You’re hurting me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like millions of his brethren, he released her. She
panted for a moment. Then she said: “We must go
in. Let me go first. Give me a few minutes’ grace.
Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mortal gentleman and triumphant lover could do
no more or no less. She sped down the terrace and
disappeared. He waited, his soul aflame. When he
entered the lounge, she was not there. He saw the
Dangerfields and the Watney-Holcombes and one or
two others sitting in a group over straw-equipped
glasses. He knew that Lucilla was not in the dancing-room.
He knew that she had fled to solitude. Cheery
Watney-Holcombe catching sight of him, waved an
inviting hand. Martin, longing for the sweet loneliness
of the velvet night, did not dare refuse. His
wits were sharpened. Refusal would give cause for
intolerable gossip. He came forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you done with Lucilla?” cried Mrs.
Dangerfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has gone to bed. We’ve had a heavy day.
She’s dead beat,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus he entered into the Kingdom of the Men
of the World.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span><h1>CHAPTER XX</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> next morning, Martin enquiring for Miss
Merriton learned that she had already started
on a sketching excursion with Hassan, the old,
one-eyed dragoman. Her destination was unknown;
but the fact that Hassan had taken charge of a basket
containing luncheon augured a late return. Martin
spent a sorry forenoon at Karnak which, deprived of
the vivifying influence of the only goddess that had
ever graced its precincts, seemed dead, forlorn and
vain. It was a day, too, of khamsin, when hot stones
and sand are an abomination to the gasping and perspiring
sense. And yet Lucilla had gone off into the
desert. She would faint at her easel. She would get
sunstroke. She would be brought back dead. And
anxious Martin joined a languid luncheon table. There
was talk of the absent one. If she had not been Lucilla
they would have accounted her mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat through the sweltering afternoon on the
eastern terrace over a novel which he could not
read. Last night he had held her passionately in his
arms. Her surrender had been absolute and eloquent
avowal. Already the masculine instinct of possession
spoke. Why did she now elude him? He had counted
on a morning of joy that would have eclipsed the night.
Why had she gone? Deep thought brought comforting
solution. To-morrow they were to migrate to
Assouan. This was their last day in Luxor where,
up to now, Lucilla had not made one single sketch.
Now, had she not told him in Brantôme that her
object in going to Egypt was to paint it? Generously
she had put aside her art for his sake—until the last
moment. Of this last moment she was taking advantage.
Still—why not a little word to him? He turned
to his book. But the thrill of the great kiss pulsated
through his veins. He gave himself up to dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the afternoon, Watney-Holcombe, fly-whisk
in one hand and handkerchief in the other, took him
into the cool, darkened bar, and supplied him with icy
drink and told him tales of his early days in San Francisco.
A few other men lounged in and joined them.
Desultory talk furnished an excuse for systematic imbibing
of cold liquid. When Martin reached the upper
air he found that Lucilla had already arrived and
had gone to her room for rest. He only saw her when
she came down late for dinner. She was dressed in
a close-fitting charmeuse gown of a strange blue shade
like an Egyptian evening. Her pleasant greeting differed
no whit from that of twenty-four hours ago.
Not by the flicker of a brown eyelash did she betray
recollection of last night’s impassioned happenings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She talked of her excursion to the eager and reproachful
group. A sandstorm had ruined a masterpiece,
her best brushes, her hair and old Hassan’s
temper. She had swallowed half Sahara with her
food. Her very donkey, cocking round an angry eye,
had called her the most opprobrious term in his vocabulary—an
ass. Altogether she had enjoyed herself
immensely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to have come, Martin,” she said coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made the obvious retort. “You did not give
me the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only you had been up at dawn,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was,” he replied. “I lay awake most of the
night and I saw the sunrise from my bedroom window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear!” she sighed. “You were looking the
wrong way. You were adoring the East while I was
going out to the West.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that is very pretty, but I’m dying of hunger,”
said Watney-Holcombe, carrying her off to the dining
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest followed. At table, she sat between her
captor and Dangerfield, so that Martin had no private
speech with her. After dinner Watney-Holcombe and
Dangerfield wandered off to the bar to play billiards.
Martin declining an invitation to join them remained
with the four ladies in the lounge. Lucilla had manœuvred
herself into an unassailable position between
the two married women. Martin and Maisie sat
sketchily on the outskirts behind the coffee table. The
band discoursed unexhilarating music. Talk languished.
At last Maisie sprang to her feet and took
Martin unceremoniously by the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I sit here much longer I shall sob. Come on
out and do something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin rose. “What can we do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything. We can gaze at the stars and you can
swear that you love me. Or we can go and look at
Cook’s steamboat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come with us, Lucilla?” asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head and smiled. “I’m far too tired
and lazy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl, still holding his arm, swung him round.
He had no choice but to obey. They walked along
the quay as far as the northern end of the temple. By
the time of their return Lucilla had gone to bed. She
had become as elusive as a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not capture her till the next morning on the
railway station platform, before their train started.
By a chance of which he took swift advantage, she
stood some paces apart from the little group of
friends. He carried her further away. Moments
were precious; he went at once to the root of the
matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucilla, why are you avoiding me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened wide eyes. “Avoiding you, my dear
Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yesterday you gave me no opportunity of speaking
to you, and this morning it has been the same.
And I’ve been in a fever of longing for a word with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” she said. “And now you have me,
what is the word?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush,” she whispered, with an involuntary glance
round at the red-jerseyed porters and the stray passengers.
“This is scarcely the place for a declaration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The declaration was the night before last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” she said again, and laid her gloved hand
on his arm. But he insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t forgotten?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet. How could I? You must give me time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A horrible pain shot through him. “Do you want
to forget all that has passed between us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her eyes, frankly, and laughed. “My
dear boy, how can we go into such intimate matters
among this rabble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear,” said Martin, “I am only asking a
very simple question. Do you want to forget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not quite,” she replied softly, and the
pain through his heart ceased and he held up his head
and laughed, and then bent it towards her and asked
forgiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I didn’t forgive you, I suppose you’d be miserable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abjectly wretched,” he declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wouldn’t be a fit frame of mind for a six-hour
stifling and dusty railway journey. So let us be happy
while we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Assouan they went to the hotel on the little green
island in the middle of the Nile. In the hope of her
redeeming a half promise of early descent before dinner,
he dressed betimes and waited in the long lounge,
his eyes on the lift. She appeared at last, fresh, radiant,
as though she had stepped out of the dawn. She
sat beside him with an adorable suggestion of intimacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin,” she said, “I want you to make me a promise,
will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes on hers, he promised blindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Promise me to be good while we’re here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good?” he queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Don’t you know what ‘good’ means? It
means not to be tempestuous or foolish or inquisitive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Martin, with a frown between his
brows. “I mustn’t”—he hesitated—“I mustn’t do
what I did the other night, and I mustn’t say that all
my universe, earth and sun and moon and stars are
packed in this”—his fingers met the drapery of her
bodice in a fugitive, delicate touch—“and I mustn’t
ask you any questions about what you may be thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a new tone in his voice, a new expression
in his eyes and about the corners of his lips, all of
which she was quick to note. She cast him a swift
glance of apprehension, and her smile faded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You set out the position with startling concreteness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” said he. “Up to a couple of days ago I
worshipped you as a divine abstraction. The night before
last, things, to use your words, became startlingly
concrete. You are none the less wonderful and adorable,
but you have become the concrete woman of flesh
and blood I want and would sell my soul for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at him again, anxiously, furtively, half
afraid. In such terms do none but masterful men
speak to women; men who from experience of a deceitful
sex know how to tear away ridiculous veils; or
else men who, having no knowledge of woman whatever,
suddenly awaken with primitive brutality to the
sex instinct. Her subtle brain worked out the rapid
solution. Her charming idea of making a man of
Martin had succeeded beyond her most romantic expectations.
She realised that facing him dry and cold,
as she was doing now, would only develop a dramatic
situation which would be cut uncomfortably short by
the first careless friend who stepped out of the lift.
She temporised, summoning the smile to her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway, you’ve promised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, you can’t stand with a pistol at my head
whenever we meet alone. You must give me time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To forget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To make up my mind whether to forget or remember,”
she declared radiantly. “Now what more do
you want an embarrassed woman to say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swiftly she had reassumed command. Martin
yielded happily. “If it isn’t all I want,” said he, “it’s
much more than I dared claim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and he rose too. She passed her hand
through his arm. “Come and see whether anybody
has had the common sense to reserve a table for dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus during her royal pleasure, their semi-loverlike
relations were established; rather perhaps were they
nicely balanced on a knife-edge, the equilibrium dependent
on her skill. As at Luxor, so at Assouan did
they the things that those who go to Assouan do.
They lounged about the hotel garden. They took the
motor ferry to the little town on the mainland and
wandered about the tiny bazaar. They sailed on the
Nile. They went to the merriest race meetings in
heathendom, where you can back your fancy in camel,
donkey or buffalo for a shilling upwards at the state
<span class='it'>pari-mutuel</span>. They made an expedition to the Dam.
The main occupation, as it is that of most who go to
Assouan, was not to pass the time, but to sit in the sun
and let the time pass. A golden fortnight or so
slipped by. Martin lived as freely in his goddess’s
company as he had done at Cairo or Luxor. She had
ordained a period of probation. All his delicacy of
sentiment proclaimed her justified. She comported
herself as the most gracious of divinities, and the most
warmly sympathetic of human women, leading him
by all the delicate devices known to Olympus and Clapham
Common, to lay bare to her his inmost soul. He
told her all that he had to tell: much that he had told
already: his childhood in Switzerland, his broken
Cambridge career, his life at Margett’s Universal College,
his adventures with Corinna, his waiterdom at
Brantôme, his relations with Fortinbras, Bigourdin,
Félise. The only thing in his simple past that he hid
was his knowledge of the tragedy in the life of Fortinbras.
“And then you came,” said he, “and touched my
dull earth, and turned it into a New Jerusalem of ‘pure
gold like unto clear glass.’ ” And he told her of his
consultation with the Dealer in Happiness, and his
journey to London and his meeting with Corinna in
the flimsy flat. It seemed to him that she had the divine
power of taking his heart in her blue-veined hands
and making it speak like that of a child. For everything
in the world for which that heart had longed she
had the genius to create expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of all the delicious intimacy of such revelation
he observed his compact loyally. For the quivering
moment it was enough that she knew and accepted
his love; it was enough to realise that when she
smiled on him, she must remember unresentfully the
few holy seconds of his embrace. And yet, when alone
with her, in the moonlit garden, so near that accidental
touch of arm or swinging touch of skirt or other delicate
physical sense of her, was an essential part of
their intercourse, he wondered whether she had a notion
of the madness that surged in his blood, of the
tensity of the grip in which he held himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, lotus-eating, reckless of the future, happy
only in the throbbing present, he remained with Lucilla
and her friends at Assouan until the heat of spring
drove them back to Cairo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, on the terrace of Shepheard’s, on the noon of
his arrival, he found Fortinbras. The Dealer in Happiness,
economically personally (though philosophically)
conducted, had also visited Luxor and had
brought away a rich harvest of observation. He bestowed
it liberally on Martin, who, listening with perplexed
brow, wondered whether he himself had
brought away but chaff. After a while Fortinbras
enquired:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the stock we wot of—is it still booming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin said: “I’ve been inconceivably happy. Don’t
let us talk about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Lucilla and Mrs. Dangerfield joined them
and Fortinbras was carried off to the Semiramis to
lunch. It was a gay meal. The Watney-Holcombes
had gathered in a few young soldiers, and youth asserted
itself joyously. Fortinbras, urbane and debonair,
laughed with the youngest. The subalterns
thinking him a personage of high importance who was
unbending for their benefit, paid him touching deference.
He exerted himself to please, dealing out
happiness lavishly; yet his bland eyes kept keen watch
on Martin and Lucilla sitting together on the opposite
side of the great round table. Once he caught and
held her glance for a few seconds; then she flushed,
as it seemed, angrily, and flung him an irrelevant question
about Félise. When the meal was over and he
had taken leave of his hosts, he said to Martin, who
accompanied him to the West door by which he elected
to emerge:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Either you will never want me again, or you will
want a friendly hand more than you have wanted a
friendly hand in your life before—and I am leaving
this land of enchantment the day after to-morrow.
<span class='it'>Dulce est dissipere etc.</span> But dissipation is the thief
of professional advancement. If a dealer in cheaper
and shoddier happiness arises in the quartier I am lost.
There was already before I left, a conscientious and
conscienceless Teuton who was trying to steal my
thunder and retail it at the ignominous rate of a franc
a reverberation. I cannot afford to let things drift.
Neither, my son,” he tapped the young man impressively
on the shoulder. “Neither can you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin straightened himself, half resentful, and
twirled his trim moustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very well, my son,” said Fortinbras with his
benevolent smile, “but all the let-Hell-come airs in the
world can’t do anything else but intensify the fact that
you’re a Soldier of Fortune. Faint heart—you know
the jingle—and faintness of heart is not the attribute
of a soldier. Good-bye, my dear Martin.” He held
out his hand. “You will see me to-morrow at our
usual haunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras waved adieu. Martin lit a cigarette and
sat in a far corner of the verandah. The westering
sun beat heavily on the striped awning. Further along,
by the door, a small group of visitors were gathered
round an Indian juggler. For the first time, almost,
since his landing in Egypt, he permitted himself to
think. A Soldier of Fortune. The words conveyed
sinister significance: a predatory swash-buckler in
search of any fortune to his hand: Lucilla’s fortune.
Hitherto he had blinded himself to sordid considerations.
He had dived, figuratively speaking, into his
bag of sovereigns, as into a purse of Fortunatus. The
magic of destiny would provide for his material wants.
What to him, soul-centred on the ineffable woman,
were such unimportant and mean preoccupations? He
had lived in his dream. He had lived in his intoxication.
He had lived of late in the splendour of a
seismic moment. And now, crash! he came to earth.
A Soldier of Fortune. An adventurer. A swindler.
The brutal commonsense aspect grinned in his face.
On ship-board Fortinbras had warned him that he
was an adventurer. He had not heeded.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was
a Soldier of Fortune. He must strike the iron while
it was hot. That was what Fortinbras meant. He
must secure the heiress. He hated Fortinbras. The
sudden realisation of his position devastated his soul.
And yet he loved her. He desired her as he had not
dreamed it to be in a man’s power to desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last his glance rested on the little crowd around
the Indian juggler; and then suddenly he became
aware of her flashing like a dove among crows. Her
lips and eyes were filled with a child’s laughter at the
foolish conjuring. When the trick was over she turned
and, seeing him, smiled. He beckoned. She complied,
with the afterglow of amusement on her face; but
when she came near him her expression changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what’s the matter?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed a chair for her. They sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must speak to you, once and for all,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think it’s rather public?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Indian is going,” he replied, with an indicating
gesture, “and the people too. It’s too hot for
them to sit out here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what about me?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang to his feet with an apology. She laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind. We are as well here as anywhere.
Sit down. Now, why this sudden tragic resolution?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An accidental word from Fortinbras. He called
me a Soldier of Fortune. The term isn’t pretty. You
are a woman of great wealth. I am a man practically
penniless. I have no position, no profession. I am
what the world calls an adventurer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She protested. “That’s nonsense. You have been
absolutely honest with me from first to last.” ’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honest in so far as I’ve not concealed my material
situation. But honourable? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If you had known in
Brantôme that I had already dared to love you, would
you have suggested my coming to Egypt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly not,” replied Lucilla, the shadow of an
ironical smile playing about her lips. “But—we can be
quite frank—I don’t see how you could have told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I couldn’t,” he admitted. “But loving
you as I did, I ought not to have come. It was not
the part of an honourable man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His elbow on the arm of the cane chair and his chin
on his hand he looked with haggard questioning into
her eyes. She held his glance for a brief moment, then
looked down at her blue-veined hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he said, “you don’t deny it. That’s why
I call myself an adventurer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes still downcast, she said: “You have no
reason in the world to reproach yourself. As soon
as you could, with decency, tell me that you loved me,
you did. And you made it clear to me long before you
told me. And I don’t think,” she added in a low voice,
“that I showed much indignation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She intertwined her fingers nervously. “Sometimes
a woman feels it good to be loved. And I’ve felt it
good—and wonderful—all the time. Once—there was
a man, years ago; but he’s dead. Since then other
men have come along and I’ve turned them down as
gently as I could. But no one has done the mad thing
that you have done for my sake. And no one has
been so simple and loyal—and strong. You are different.
I have had the sense of being loved by a man
pure and unstained. God knows you are without
blame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, my dear,” said he, bending his head vainly
so as to catch her face otherwise than in profile and
to meet the eyes hidden beneath the adorable brown
lashes, “what is to happen between us two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer, she made a little despairing gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had the right of an honest man seeking a
woman in marriage,” he said, “I would take matters
into my own hand. I would follow you all over the
world until I won you somehow or the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned on him in a flash of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you say such things, you will make me marry
you out of humiliation and remorse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid I should do that,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She averted her head again. There was a span of
silence. At the extreme end of the long deserted
verandah, beneath the sun-baked awning, with only the
occasional clatter of a carriage or the whirr of a motor
breaking the stillness of this drowsy embankment of
the Nile, they might have been miles away in the desert
solitude under the palm-tree of Fortinbras’s dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucilla was the first to speak. “It is I who am to
blame for everything. No; let me talk. I’ve got the
courage to talk straight and you’ve got the courage to
listen. You interested me at Brantôme. Your position
there was so un-English. Of course I liked you. I
thought you ought to be roused from stagnation. It
was just idle fancy that made me talk about Egypt.
I thought it would do you good to cut everything and
see the world. When I took Félise away with me and
saw how she expanded and developed, I thought of
you. I’ve done the same often before with girls, like
Félise, who have never been given a chance, and it has
been a fascinating amusement. I had never made the
experiment with a man. I wanted to see how you would
shape, what kind of impression all the new kind of life
would make on you. I realise it now, but till now I
haven’t, that all my so-called kindnesses to girls have
been heartless experimenting. I could keep twenty
girls in luxury for twenty years without considering
the expense. That’s the curse of unlimited money!
one abuses its power.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With you, of course,
money didn’t come in. I hadn’t the insanity to ask
you to be my guest, as I could ask young women. But
money aside, I knew I could give you what I gave
them; and from what Félise let drop I gathered you
had some little private means. So I wrote to you—on
the off-chance. I thought you would come. People,
have a way of doing what I ask them. You were going
to be the most fascinating amusement of all. You
see, that’s how it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused. His face hardened. “Well,” said he,
“go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you guess the rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said he, “I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a note in his voice that seemed to tear
her heart. She pressed both hands to her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you knew how I despise and hate myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, my dear,” said Martin. He touched her
shoulder, warm and soft. Only the convention of a
diaphanous flimsy sleeve gave sanction. She let his
hand remain there for a moment or two; then gripped
it and flung it away. But the nervous clasp of her fingers
denied resentment. She turned a white face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you loved me. It was good, as I’ve told
you, to feel it. I meant to escape as I’ve escaped before.
I don’t excuse myself. Then came the night at
Luxor. I let myself go. It was a thing of the senses.
Something snapped, as it has done in the case of millions
of women under similar conditions. You could
have done what you liked with me. I shall never forget
if I live to be ninety. Do you think I’ve been sleeping
peacefully all these nights ever since? I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him defiantly. Said Martin:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must care for me—a little. The veriest little
is all I dare ask for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t,” she answered, meeting his eyes.
“Don’t delude yourself. You are asking for everything.
And if I had everything to give I would give
it to you. You may think I have played with you
heartlessly for the last three or four weeks. Any outsider
knowing the bare facts would accuse me. Perhaps
I ought to have sent you away; but I hadn’t the
strength. There. That’s a confession. Make what
you will of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All I can make of it,” said Martin tremulously, “is
that you’re the woman for me, and that you know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” she said. “I’m up against facts and I face
them squarely. On the other hand you’re not the man
for me. If ever a woman has tried to love a man, I’ve
tried to love you. That’s why I’ve made you stay.
I’ve plucked my heart out—all, all but the roots.
There’s a dead man there, at the roots”—she flung
out both hands and her shoulders heaved—“and he is
always up between us, and I can’t, I can’t. It’s no use.
I must give myself altogether, or not at all. I’m not
built for the half-and-half things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat grim, feeling more a stone than a man. She
clutched his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose I did marry you. By all the rules of the
game I ought to. But it would only be misery for
both of us. There would be twenty thousand causes
for misery. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see everything,” said Martin. He rose and leaned
both elbows on the verandah and faced her with bent
brows. “I see everything. You have put your case
very clearly. But suppose I say that you haven’t
played the game. Suppose I say that you should have
known that no man who wasn’t in love with you—except
an imbecile—would have followed you to Egypt
as I’ve done. Suppose I say that you’ve played havoc
with my life. Suppose I instance everything that has
passed between us, and I assert the rules of the game,
and I ask you as a man, shaken to his centre with
love of you, to marry me, what would you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and stood beside him, holding her head
very proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put upon my honour like that,” she replied, “I
should have to say ‘Yes.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took both her hands in his and raised them to
his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all I want to know. But as I don’t reproach
you, I’m not going to ask you, my dear. If I were
Lord of the Earth or a millionth part of the earth I
would laugh and take the risk. But as things are, I
can’t accept your generosity. You are the woman I
love and shall always love. Good-bye and God bless
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrung her hand and marched down the verandah,
his head in the air, looking a very gallant fellow. After
a few seconds’ perplexity she ran swiftly in pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and awaited her approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel I’ve behaved to you like the lowest of
women. I’ll make my amends if you like. I’ll marry
you. There!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stood racked with the great temptation. All
his senses absorbed her beauty and her wonder. At
length he asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you love me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve told you all about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you don’t.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes or No? It’s a matter
of two lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve tried and I will try again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Yes or No?” he persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he took her hands and kissed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ends it. If I married you, my dear, I should
indeed be a Soldier of Fortune, and you would have
every reason to despise me. Now it is really good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her gaze followed him until he disappeared into
the hotel. Then she moved slowly to the balustrade
baking in the sunshine, and leaning both elbows on it
stared through a blur of tears at the detested beauty
of the world.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>F</span><span class='sc'>ORTINBRAS</span> paced the deck of the homeward
bound steamer deep in thought. He still wore
the costume of the elderly cabinet minister; but
his air was that of the cabinet minister returning
to a wrecked ministry. His broad shoulders were
rounded and bent; his face had fallen from its
benevolent folds into fleshy haggardness. He felt old;
he felt inexpressibly lonely. He had not repeated the
social experiment of the voyage out. Save to his
Dutch and Russian table neighbours he had not the
heart to speak to any one. A deep melancholy enwrapped
him. After his philosophical communion with
the sage Abu Mohammed he shrank from platitudinous
commerce with the profane. It was for the heart and
not for the mind that he craved companionship. He
was travelling (second-class, for economy’s sake) back
to the old half-charlatan life. For all one’s learning
and wisdom, one cannot easily embark on a new career
in the middle-fifties. He must be <span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur</span>
to the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wondered whether he would miss Cécile. Such
things had happened. No matter how degraded, she
had been a human thing to greet him on his return
from his preposterous toil. Also, her needs had been
an incentive; they had sharpened the hawk’s vision
during the daily round of cafés and restaurants, and
quickened his pounce upon the divined five-franc piece.
Would he have the nerve, the unwearied patience, the
bitter sense of martyrdom, wherewith to carry on his
trade? Again, in days past his heavy heart had been
uplifted by the love of a child like the wild flowers
from which Alpine honey is made, away in the depths
of old-world France. But now he had forfeited her
love. She had written to him, all these weeks in Egypt,
dutifully, irreproachably; had given him the news, such
as it was, of Brantôme. She had told him of the state
of her uncle’s health—invariably robust; of the arrivals
and departures of elegant motorists; of the march
through the town decorated for the occasion of a host
of <span class='it'>petits soldats</span>, amid the enthusiasm and Marseillaise
singing of the inhabitants; of the sudden death by
apoplexy of the good Madame Chauvet, and the sudden
development of business on the part of her daughters,
who almost immediately had taken the next shop
and launched out into iron wreaths and crosses, and
artificial flowers and funeral inscriptions, touching and
pious; of the purchases of geese; of the infatuation
of the elderly Euphémie for the youthful waiter, erstwhile
<span class='it'>plongeur</span> of the Café de l’Univers; of all sorts
and conditions of unimportant happenings; finally of
the betrothal of Monsieur Lucien Viriot and Estelle
Mazabois, the daughter of the famous Mazabois who
kept a great drapery establishment of Périgueux—“she
has the dowry of a princess and the head of a
rocking-horse, so they are sure to be happy,” wrote
Félise. The manner of this last announcement shocked
him. Félise had changed. She had given him all the
news, but her letters had grown self-conscious and
artificial. To avoid the old, artless expressions of endearment,
she rushed into sprightly narrative, and
signed herself “his affectionate daughter.” He had
lost Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, he felt old and lonely, unnerved for the struggle.
Even Martin had forsaken him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had encountered a stony-faced, wrong-headed
young man on the terrace of Shepheard’s Hotel the
noon before he sailed, and found all his nostrums for
happiness high-handedly rejected. Martin had been
an idle woman’s toy, a fiery toy as it turned out; and
when she burned her fingers, she had dropped him.
So much was obvious; most of it he had foreseen.
He had counted on eventual declaration and summary
dismissal; but he had not reckoned on a prelude of
reciprocated sentiment. Contrary to habit, Martin
gave him but a confused view of his state of mind.
The unhappy lover would hear not a word against his
peerless lady. On the other hand, his love for her
had blasted his existence. This appalling fact, though
he did not proclaim it so heroically, he allowed Fortinbras
to apprehend. He neither reproached him for
past advice nor asked for new. To the suggestion that
he should return to Brantôme and accept Bigourdin’s
offer, he turned a deaf ear. He had cut himself adrift;
he must go whithersoever winds and tides should carry
him, and they were carrying him far from Périgord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what direction?” Fortinbras had enquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank Heaven, I don’t know myself,” he had answered.
“Anyhow, I am going to seek my fortune.
I must have money and power so that I can snap
my fingers at the world. That’s what I’m going to live
for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And soon after that declaration he had wrung Fortinbras
by the hand, and hailing an <span class='it'>arabeah</span> had driven
off into the unknown. Fortinbras had felt like the hen
who sees her duckling brood sail away down the brook.
He had lost control of his disciple; he mattered nothing
to the young man setting forth on his wild-goose
chase after fortune. His charming little scheme had
failed. He anticipated the reproaches of Bigourdin,
the accusation in the eyes of Félise. “Why did you
side with the enemy? Why did you drive Martin
away?” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt old and lonely, a pathetic failure; so he
walked the second-class deck with listless shoulders and
bowed head, his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tiens!</span> Monsieur Fortinbras! who would have
thought it?” cried a fresh voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked up and saw a dark-eyed girl, her head
enveloped in a motor-veil, who extended a friendly
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mademoiselle</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he began uncertainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais oui!</span> Eugénie Dubois. You must remember
me. There was also <span class='it'>le grand Jules</span>—Jules Massart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I remember,” he said courteously, with a wan
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saved us both from a pretty mess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember the saving; but I forget the mess. It
is my rule always to forget such things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed gaily, burst into an account of herself.
She was a modiste in the great Paris firm of Odille et
Compagnie, which had a branch at Cairo. Now she
was recalled for the Paris and London season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Et justement</span>”—she plucked at his sleeve and led
him to a seat—“I am in a tangle of an affair which
keeps me awake of nights. You fall upon me from the
skies like an angel. Be good and give me a consultation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fished out her purse and extracted a twenty-five
piastre piece. He motioned her hand away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon enfant</span>” said he. “You are an honourable
little soul. But I don’t do business on a holiday.
<span class='it'>Raconte-moi ton affaire.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she protested. She would not abuse his kindness.
Either a consultation at the regulation price
or no consultation at all. At last he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Eh bien!</span> give me your five francs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She obeyed. He rose. “Come,” said he, and led
the way to the stairhead by the saloon where was fixed
the collecting box in aid of the Fund for Shipwrecked
Mariners. He slipped the coin down the slot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said he, “honour is satisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But listening to her artless and complicated tale,
he wondered, while a shiver ran over his frame,
whether he would ever be able again to slip a five-franc
piece into his waistcoat pocket. He felt yet older than
before, incapable of piercing to the root of youth’s
perplexities. He counselled with oracular vagueness,
conscious of not having earned his fee. He paced the
deck again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were it not for Abu Mohammed,” he said, “I
should call it a disastrous journey.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Martin, lonelier even than he, sat in the
bows of a great Eastward bound steamer, his eyes
opened to the staring facts of life. No longer must
he masquerade as the man of fashion—never again
until he had bought the right. The remains of his
small capital he must keep intact for the day of need.
No more the luxury of first-class travel. This voyage
in the steerage was but a means of transit to the
new lands where he would win his way to fortune.
He needed no advice. He had spiritually and morally
outgrown his tutelage. No longer, so he told himself,
would he nourish his soul on dreams. It could feed
if it liked on memories. The madness had passed. He
drew the breath of an honest man. If he had taken
Lucilla at her word and married her, what would
have been his existence? Trailing about the idle world
in the wake of a rich wife, dependent on her bounty
even for a pair of shoe-laces; eating out his heart
for the love she could not give; at last, perhaps, quarrelling
desperately, or else with sapped will-power sunk
in sloth, accepting from her an allowance on condition
that they should live apart. He had heard of such
marriages since he had mingled with the wealthy.
Even had she met him with a love as passionate as
his own, would the happiness have lasted? In his grim
mood he thought not. He reasoned himself into the
conviction that his loss had been his gain. Far better
that he should be among these few poor folk who sat
down to table in their shirt-sleeves, than that he should
be eating the flesh-pots of dishonour in the land of
Egypt. He himself dined in his shirt-sleeves, as he
had done many a time before in the kitchen of the
Hôtel des Grottes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he hungered for her. It seemed impossible that
he should never see her again, never again watch the
sweep of the adorable brown eyelashes, the subtle play
of laughter around her mobile lips; never again greet
with delicious heart-pang the sight of her slim figure
willowy like those in the <span class='it'>Primavera</span>. In vain he
schooled himself to regard her as one dead. The
witchery of her obsessed him night and day. He
learned what it was to suffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had taken his deck passage to Hong-Kong—why
he could scarcely tell. It sounded very far away—as
far away from her as practicable. As the sultry
days went on, he realised that he had not reckoned
on the tremendous distance of Hong-Kong. It was
past Bombay, Colombo, Penang and Singapore. At
such ports as he could, he landed, but the glamour of
the East had gone. He was a man who had expended
his power of wonder and delight. He looked on them
coldly as places he might possibly exploit, should Hong-Kong
prove barren. Also the period of great heat
had begun, and he found danger in strolling about the
deadly streets. On ship-board he slept on deck. As
they neared Hong-Kong his heart sank. For the first
time he wished that Fortinbras were with him. Perhaps
he had repaid affection with scant courtesy. He
occupied himself with a long letter to his friend, setting
out his case. He then imagined the reply. “My
son,” said the mellow, persuasive voice, “have you not
been carrying on from thrill to thrill the Great Adventure
begun last August, when you threw off the
chains of Margett’s? Have you not filled your brain
and your soul with new and breathless sensations?
Have you not tasted joys hitherto unimagined? Have
you not been admitted to the heart of a great and loyal
nation? Have you not flaunted it in the dazzling splendour
of the great world? Have you not steeped your
being in the gorgeous colour of the East? Have not
your pulses throbbed with an immortal passion for a
woman of surpassing beauty? Have you not known,
what is only accorded to the select of the sons of men,
a supreme moment of delirious joy when Time stood
still and Space was not? Have you not lived intensely
all this wonderful year? Are you the same blank-minded,
starving-souled, mild negation of a man who
sat as a butt for Corinna’s pleasantries at the Petit
Cornichon? Have you not progressed immeasurably?
Have you not gained spiritual stature, wisdom both
human and godlike? And are you not now, having
passed through the fiery furnace not only unscathed
but tempered, setting out on the still greater adventure—the
conquest of the Ends of the Earth? Less than
a year ago what were you but a slave? What are you
now? A free man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So through the ears of fancy ran the sonorous rhetoric
of Fortinbras. Martin tore up his letter and
scattered the fragments on the sea. A day or two
afterwards, with a stout heart, he landed at Victoria,
the capital of Hong-Kong.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A half-caste clerk to whom he had entrusted his
card returned from the inner office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Tudsley will see you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin followed him into a darkened office, cooled
by an electric fan, where a white-clad, gaunt, yellow-faced
Englishman sat at a desk. The clerk closed the
door and retired. The yellow-faced Englishman rose
and smiled, after glancing at Martin’s card on the desk
before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Overshaw? What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can give me some work,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” said Martin. “I must apologise for
troubling you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about to withdraw. Mr. Tudsley glanced
at him shrewdly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute. Sit down. I don’t seem to place
you. Who are you and where do you come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my name,” said Martin, pointing to his card,
“and I have just arrived from Europe, or to be more
exact, from Egypt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the <span class='it'>Sesostris?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Tudsley took up and scanned a type-written
sheet of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see your name on the passenger list.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly not,” said Martin. “I came steerage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed?” Martin, spruce in his well-cut grey flannels,
looked anything but a deck passenger. “What
made you do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Economy,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why have you come to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made a list last night, at the hotel, of the leading
firms in Hong-Kong and yours was among
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you any introductions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what induced you to come to this particular
little Hell upon Earth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chance,” said Martin. “One place is pretty much
the same to me as another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of work are you looking for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything. From sweeping the floor to running a
business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only coolies sweep floors here,” said Mr. Tudsley,
tilting back his chair and clasping his hands behind
his back. “And only experienced men of business run
businesses. What business have you run?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what business qualifications have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None. But I’m an educated man—Cambridge——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, one sees that,” the other interrupted.
“There are millions of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m bilingual, English and French, and my German
is good enough for ordinary purposes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know anything of accounts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you add up figures correctly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I daresay,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever tried?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Tudsley handed him a mass of type-written
papers pinned together. “Do you know what that is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin glanced through the document. “It seems
to be a list of commodities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a Bill of Lading. First time you’ve ever seen
one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any capital?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little. A few hundred pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then stick to it like grim death. Don’t part with
it here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t the slightest intention of doing so,” said
Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lean, yellow-faced man brought his chair back
to normal perpendicularity and swung it round—it
worked on a swivel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Overshaw,” said he, “pardon a perfect stranger
giving you advice—but you seem to be a frank, straight
man. You’ve made a mistake in coming to Hong-Kong.
It’s a beast of a climate. In a few days’ time
the rains will begin. Then it will rain steadily, drearily,
hopelessly, damply, swelteringly, deadlily day after
day, hour after hour, for four months. That’s one
way of looking at things. There’s another. I am perfectly
sure there’s not a vacancy for an amateur clerk
in the whole of Hong-Kong. If we want a linguist—your
specialty—we can get Germans by the dozen who
not only know six languages but who have been trained
as business experts from childhood—and we can get
them for twopence halfpenny a month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, remembering the discussions at the Café
de l’Univers, replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when the war comes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Between England and Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow, what in the world are you talking
of? There’s not going to be any war. Besides,” he
smiled indulgently, “suppose there was—what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First,” said Martin, “you would have given the
enemy an intimate knowledge of your trade, which by
the way he is even now reporting by every mail to his
government”—he was quoting the dictum of a highly
placed Egyptian official whom he met at a dinner party
in Cairo—“and then you would have to fall back upon
Englishmen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Tudsley laughed and rose, so as to end the interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take the risk of that,” he said easily. “But the
immediate question is: ‘What are you to do?’ Have
you visited any other firms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Several,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what have they said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much the same as you, Mr. Tudsley, only not so
kindly and courteously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” said Mr. Tudsley, shy at the
compliment. “I don’t see why Englishmen meeting
at the other end of nowhere shouldn’t be civil to each
other. But my advice is: Clear out of Hong-Kong.
There’s nothing doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about Shanghai?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s further still from Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Singapore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s better—on the way back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must thank you,” said Martin, “for giving me
so much of your time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit I am only sorry I can’t give you a job
or put you on to one. But you see the position, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin smiled wryly. “I’m beginning to see it with
painful clearness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye and good luck,” said Mr. Tudsley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between then and the date of sailing of the next
homeward bound steamer, Martin knocked at every
door in Hong-Kong. Nobody wanted him. There
was nothing he could do. There was no place for him
on the very lowest rung of any ladder to fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sailed to Singapore.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span><span class='sc'>HEN</span> Martin landed at Marseilles he found
the world on the brink of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had spent the early summer roaming
about the East looking, as he had looked at Hong-Kong,
for work that might lead to fortune and finding
none. A touch of fever had caused a friendly doctor
at Penang to pack him off to Europe by the first
boat. It had been a Will o’ the Wisp chase mainly in
the rains, when the Straits Settlements are not abodes
of delight. It is bad enough that your boots should be
mildewed every morning; but when the mildew begins
to attack your bones it is best to depart. Martin embarked
philosophically. He had tried the East because
it was nearer to his original point of departure. Now
he would try the West—America or Canada. In a
temperate climate he could undertake physical labour.
His muscles were solid, and save for the touch of
fever of which the sea-air had soon cured him, his
health was robust. He could hew wood, draw water,
dig the earth. In a new country he could not starve.
At the last pinch he could fall back on the profession
he had learned at the Hôtel des Grottes. Furthermore,
by eating the bread and choosing the couch of hardship
he had spent comparatively little of his capital.
His vagabondage had hardened him physically and
morally. He knew the world. He had mixed with all
kinds and conditions of men. Egypt seemed a sensuous
dream of long ago. He deafened his heart to its
memories. It would take ten years to make anything
of a fortune. If he succeeded, then, in ten years’ time,
he would seek Lucilla. In the meanwhile he would not
waste away in despair. He faced the future with confidence.
While standing with his humble fellow passengers
in the bows of the vessel, he felt his pulses
thrill at the first sight of the blue islands of Marseilles.
It was France, country almost of his adoption. He
rejoiced that he had decided not to book his ticket to
Southampton, but to pass through the beloved land
once again before he sailed to another Hemisphere.
Besides, his money and most of his personal effects
(despatched from Egypt) were lying at Cook’s office
in Paris. The practical therefore turned sentiment
into an easy channel. He landed, carrying his bag in
his hand, bought a paper on the quay from a screaming
urchin, and to his stupefaction found the world
on the brink of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Gibraltar he had not seen a newspaper. None
had penetrated to the steerage and he had not landed.
He had taken it for granted that the good, comfortable
old earth was rolling its usual course. Now, at Marseilles,
he became aware of every one in the blazing
sunshine of the quays staring at newspapers held open
before them. At the modest hotel hard by, where he
deposited his bag, he questioned the manager. Yes,
did not he know? Austria had declared war on Servia.
Germany had rejected all proposals from England for
a conference. The President of the Republic had
hurried from Russia. Russia would not allow Servia
to be attacked by Austria. France must join Russia.
It was a <span class='it'>coup</span> prepared by Germany. “<span class='it'>Ca y est, c’est
la guerre</span>,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went out into the streets and found a place
on the crowded terrace of one of the cafés on the
Cannebière. All around him was the talk of war. The
rich-voiced Provençaux do not speak in whispers.
There was but one hope for peace, the successful intervention
of England between Russia and Austria.
But Germany would not have it. War was inevitable.
Martin bribed a chasseur to find him some English
papers, no matter of what date. With fervent anxiety
he scanned the history of the momentous week. What
he read confirmed the talk. Whatever action England
might take, France would be at war in a few days. He
paid for his drink and walked up the Cannebière. He
saw no smiling faces. The shadow of war already
overspread the joyous town. A battalion of infantry
passed by, and people stood still involuntarily and
watched the soldiers with looks curiously stern. And
Martin stood also, and remained standing long after
the clanging tram-cars temporarily held up had blocked
them from his sight. And he knew that he could not
go to America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a little spot in the heart of France lived all the
friends he had in the world; all the brave souls he
had learned to love. Brantôme appeared before him
as in a revelation, and a consciousness of ingratitude
smote him so that he drew a gasping breath. Not that
he had forgotten them. He had kept up a fitful correspondence
with Bigourdin who had never hinted a
reproach. But until an hour or two ago he had been
prepared to wipe Brantôme out of his life, to pass
through France without giving it an hour of greeting—even
an <span class='it'>ave atque vale</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the past seven months of mad folly and studied
poverty, where had he met characters so strong, ideals
so lofty, hearts so loyal? What had he learned among
the careless superficial Anglo-American society in
Egypt comparable with that which he had learned in
this world-forgotten little bourgeoisie in France?
Which of them had touched his nature below the layer
of his vanity? What ideals had he met with in the
East? Could he so term the complacent and pessimistic
opportunism of the Tudsleys; the querulous grumbling
of officials; the honest dulness of sea-captains and seamen?
He judged superficially, it is true; for one has
to strike deep before one can get at the shy soul of a
Briton. But a man is but the creature of his impressions.
From his own particular journeyings of seven
months he had returned almost bewilderingly alone.
East of Marseilles there dwelt not a human being
whose call no matter how faint sounded in his ears.
England, in so far as intimate personal England was
concerned, had no call for him either. Nor had
America, unknown, remote, unfriendly as Greenland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jostled, he walked along the busy thoroughfare, a
man far away, treading the paths of the spirit. In
this mighty convulsion that threatened the earth, there
was one spot which summoned him, with a call clear
and insistent. His place was there, in Périgord, to
share in its hopes and its fears, its mourning and its
joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned to the hotel for his bag and took the
first train in the direction of Brantôme. What he
would do when arrived, he had no definite notion. It
was something beyond reason that drove him thither.
Something irresistible; more irresistible than the force
which had impelled him to Egypt. Then he had hesitated,
weighed things for and against. Now, one moment
had decided him. It never occurred to him to
question. Through the burning south of France he
sped. As yet only the shadow of war hung over the
land; the awful Word had not yet gone forth. Swarthy
men and women worked in the baking vineyards and
gathered in the yellow harvest. But here and there on
flashing glimpses of white road troops marched dustily
and military waggons lumbered along. And in the
narrow, wooden-seated third-class carriage on the slow
and ever stopping train, the talk even of the humblest
was of war. At every station some of the passengers
left, some entered. There seemed to be a sudden concentration
homewards. At every station were soldiers
recalled from leave to their garrisons. These, during
the journey, were questioned as authoritative functionaries.
Yes, for sure, there would be war. Why they
did not know, except that the <span class='it'>sales bêtes</span> of Germans
were, at last, going to invade France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said one, “I saw an officer yesterday in our village—the
son of Monsieur le Comte de Boirelles who has
the big <span class='it'>château là-bas</span>—we have known each other
from childhood—and he said, ‘<span class='it'>Hein, mon brave, ca y
est!</span>’ And I said: ‘What, <span class='it'>mon lieutenant</span>?’ And he
said, ‘<span class='it'>V’là le son, le son du canon</span>.’ Fight like a good
son of Boirelles, or I’ll cut off your ears.’ And I
replied, <span class='it'>quasiment comme ça</span>: ‘You will not have the
opportunity, <span class='it'>mon lieutenant</span>, you being in the artillery
and I in the infantry.’ And he laughed with good
heart. ‘Anyhow,’ said he, ‘if you return to the village,
when the war is over, without the military medal, and
I am alive, I’ll make my mother do it, in the courtyard
of the château, with her own scissors.’ I tell you
this to prove to you that I know there is going to be
war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the women, holding their blue bundles on their
knees in the crowded compartment—for in democratic
France demos is not allowed the luxury of luggage-racks—looked
at the future with anxious eyes. What
would become of them? The government would take
their men. Their men would be killed or maimed.
Even if the men returned safe and sound, in the meantime,
how would they live? <span class='it'>Ah, mon Dieu! Cette
rosse de guerre!</span> They cursed the war as though it
were a foul and conscious entity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interminable journey, by day, by night, with
tedious waits at great ghostly junctions, at last was
over. Martin emerged from the station of Brantôme
and immediately before him stood the familiar ramshackle
omnibus of the Hôtel des Grottes. Old Grégoire,
the driver, on beholding him staggered back and
almost fell over the step of the vehicle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Monsieur Martin! C’est vous?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recovering, he advanced with great, sun-glazed
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It is indeed I,” laughed Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is everybody that will be content,” cried Grégoire.
“How one has talked of you, and wished you
were back. And now, that this <span class='it'>sacrée guerre</span> is coming——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why I’ve come,” said Martin. “How are
monsieur and mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both were well. It was they who would be glad to
see Monsieur Martin. The old fellow, red-faced, white-haired,
clean shaven, with a comfortable gash of
a mouth, clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais v’là un solide gaillard?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tu trouves?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why, of course Grégoire found him transformed
into a stout fellow. When he had arrived a year ago
he was like a bit of wet string. What a thing it was
to travel. And yet he had been in China where people
ate rats and dogs, which could not be nourishing food.
In a fortnight, on the good meat and <span class='it'>foie gras</span> of
Périgord, he would develop into a veritable giant. If
Monsieur Martin would enter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He held the door
open. No one else had arrived by the train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The omnibus jolted and swayed along the familiar
road, through the familiar cobble-paved streets, along
the familiar quays, past many a familiar face. They
all seemed to chant the welcome of which the old
driver had struck the key. Martin felt strangely happy
and the tears were very near his eyes. Monsieur Richard,
the butcher, catching sight of him, darted a pace
or two down the pavement so as to make sure, and
threw up both hands in greeting. And as they turned
the corner of the hill surmounted by the dear grey
tower of the old Abbey, Monsieur le Curé saw him
and smiled and swept a salute with his old dusty hat,
which Martin acknowledged through the end window
of the omnibus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drew up before the familiar door of the old
white inn. Baptiste was there, elderly, battered, in
his green baize apron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais, mon Dieu, c’est vous?—mais—— </span>” He
wrung Martin’s hand. And, as once before, on the
return of Félise, not being able to cope with his emotions,
he shouted on the threshold of the vestibule:
“<span class='it'>Monsieur, monsieur, c’est Monsieur Martin qui arrive!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Qu’est-ce que tu dis là?</span>” cried a familiar voice from
the bureau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est Monsieur Martin.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin entered, and in the vestibule encountered
Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais mon vieux</span>,” cried the vast man. “<span class='it'>C’est toi?
C’est vraiment toi, enfin?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the instinctive, surprised and joyous greeting
of the two servants. Martin stood unstrung. What
had he done to deserve it? Before he could utter a
word, he felt two colossal arms swung round him and
a kiss implanted on each cheek. Then Bigourdin held
him out and looked at him, and, like Grégoire, told
him how solid he looked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Enfin!</span> You’ve come back. Tell me how and when
and why. Tell me all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s eyes were moist. “My God!” said he, with
a catch in his voice, “you are a good fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit, <span class='it'>mon cher</span>. We are friends, and
in friendship there is something just a little bit
sacred. But tell me, <span class='it'>nom d’une pipe!</span> all about yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was on my way,” said Martin, with his conscientious
honesty, “from Penang to New York. At
Marseilles I heard for the first time of the war in which
France will be involved and of which we have so
often talked. And something, I don’t know what,
called me here—<span class='it'>et me voici!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est beau. C’est bien beau de ta part</span>,” said Bigourdin
seriously. “Let us go and find Félise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, when a Frenchman characterises a deed as
<span class='it'>beau</span>, it is in his opinion very fine indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before they could move, Euphémie rushed from
her kitchen and all but embraced the wanderer and
Joseph, late <span class='it'>plongeur</span> at the Café de l’Univers and now
waiter at the hôtel, came shyly from the <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>,
and the brightness of his eyes was only equalled by the
lustre of the habiliments that formerly had belonged
to Martin. Bigourdin despatched him in quest of
Félise. Soon she came, from the <span class='it'>fabrique</span>, looking
rather white. Joseph had shot his news at her. But
she came up looking Martin straight in the eyes, her
hand extended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bonjour</span>, Martin. I am glad to see you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I,” said he. “More than glad. It’s like
coming back to one’s own people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew up her little head and asked with a certain
bravura: “How is Lucilla?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced; but he did not show it. He smiled.
“I don’t know. I haven’t heard of her since March.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither have I,” she said. “Not since January.
She seems to be a bird of passage through other people’s
lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin laughed, shaking a great forefinger. “I
bet that is not original. I bet you are quoting your
old philosopher of a father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She coloured and said defiantly: “Yes. I confess
it. It is none the less true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how is the good Fortinbras?” asked Martin,
to turn a distressful conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A merveille!</span> We are expecting him by any train.
It is I who am making him come. To-morrow I may
be called out. France will want more than the Troupes
Métropolitaines and the Réserves to fight the Germans.
They will want the Territorials, <span class='it'>et c’est moi, l’armée
territoriale</span>.” He thumped his chest. “It was written
that I should strike a blow for France like my fathers.
But while I am striking the blow who is to look after
my little Félise and the Hôtel des Grottes? It is well
to be prepared. When the mobilisation is ordered,
there will be no more trains for civilians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what do you feel about the war, Félise?”
asked Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clenched her hands: “I would give my immortal
soul to be a man!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin hugged her. “That is a daughter of
France! I am proud of our little girl. <span class='it'>On dirait une
Jeanne d’Arc.</span> But where is the Frenchwoman now
who is not animated by the spirit of La Pucelle d’Orléans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the meanwhile, <span class='it'>mon oncle</span>,” said Félise, disengaging
herself demurely from his embrace, “Martin
looks exceedingly dusty and hungry, and no one has
even suggested that he should wash or eat or have his
bag carried up to his room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin regarded her with admiration. “She is
wonderful. She thinks of everything. Baptiste. Take
up Monsieur Martin’s things to the <span class='it'>chambre d’honneur</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear fellow,” Martin protested, “I only
want my old room in which I have slept so soundly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bigourdin would have none of it. He was the
Prodigal Son. “<span class='it'>Et justement!</span>” he cried, slapping his
thigh, “we have a good calf’s head for <span class='it'>déjeuner</span>. Yes,
it’s true,” he laughed delightedly. “The fatted calf.
It was fatted by our neighbour Richard. <span class='it'>C’est extraordinaire!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin shaved and washed in the famous bath
room, and changed, and descended to the <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>.
The only guests were a few anxious-faced commercial
travellers at the centre table. All but one were
old acquaintances. He went the round, shaking hands,
amid cordial greetings. It was the last time, they said.
To-morrow they would be mobilised. The day after
they would exchange the sample box for the pack of
the soldier; in a week they would have the skin torn
off the soles of their feet; and in a month they would
be blown to bits by shells. They proclaimed a lack of
the warrior spirit. They had a horror of blood, even
a cat’s. It stirred up one’s stomach. <span class='it'>Mais enfin</span> one
did not think of such unimportant things when France
was in peril. If your house was in danger of being
swept away by flood, there was no sense in being afraid
to catch cold through having your feet wet. Each
in his way expressed the same calm fatalistic patriotism.
They had no yearning to be killed. But if they
were killed—they shrugged their shoulders. They
were France and France was they. No force could
dismember them from France without France or themselves
bleeding to death. It was very simple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin left them and sat down with Bigourdin and
Félise, at their table in the corner by the door. It was
the first time he had ever done so. Félise ate little
and spoke less. Now and again, as he told of his mild
adventures in the Far East, he caught her great dark
eyes fixed on him, and he smiled, unaccountably glad.
But always she shifted her glance and made a pretence
of eating or drinking. Once, when Bigourdin, called
by innkeeper’s business to one of the commercial travellers,
had left the table, she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have changed. One would say it was not the
same man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you think so?” he laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You talk differently. There is a different expression
on your face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why you should be sorry,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you no longer recognise me,” said he—they
talked in French—“I must come to you as a stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bit her lip and flushed. “I did not know what
I was saying. Perhaps it was impertinent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could it be, Félise?” he asked, bending across
the table. “But if I have changed, is it for the better
or the worse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you be a waiter here again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin looked for a second into his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Voilà!</span>” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I couldn’t tell you why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not necessary,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin joined them. The meal ended. Félise
went off to her duties. Bigourdin said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go and drink our coffee at the Café de
l’Univers. Everybody is there, at this hour, the last
day or two. We may learn some news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They descended the hill and walked along the blazing
quays. Martin knew every house, every stone,
every old woman who pausing from beating her linen
on the side of the Dronne waved him a welcome. And
men stopped him and slapped his shoulder and shook
him by the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You recognise the good heart of Périgord,” said
Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin replied, with excusable Gallic hyperbole:
“<span class='it'>C’est mon pays</span>. I find it again, after having wandered
over the earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned into the narrow, cool Rue de Périgueux.
On the opposite side of the street, they saw Monsieur
Foure, <span class='it'>adjoint du maire</span>, walking furiously, mopping
a red forehead, soft straw hat in hand. He sped
across to them, too excited to realise that Martin had
gone and returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you heard the news? The Mayor has received
a telegram from Paris. The order of mobilisation
goes out to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bon</span>,” said Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The terrace of the Café de l’Univers was crowded
with the notables of the town, who, in their sober
way, only frequented the café after dinner. The special
côterie had their section apart, as at night. They
were all assembled—Fénille of the Compagnie du Gaz;
Beuzot, Professor of the Ecole Normale; the Viriots,
father and son; Thiébauld, managing director of the
quarries; Bénoît of the railway; Rutillard, the great
chandler of corn and hay; and they did not need the
<span class='it'>adjoint du Maire</span> to tell them the news. The fresh
arrivals, provided speedily with chairs by the waiters,
were swallowed up in the group. And Martin was
assailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Et maintenant, l’Angleterre. Qu’est-ce qu’elle va
faire?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the question on all French lips that day until
England declared war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Martin proclaimed, as though inspired from
Whitehall, that England would fight. For the moment
his declaration satisfied them. The talk swayed from
him excitedly. France at war, at last, after forty
years, held their souls. They talked in the air, as men
will, of numbers, of preparations, of chances, of the
solidarity of the nation. When there was a little pause,
the square-headed, white-haired Monsieur Viriot rose
and with a gesture, imposed silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a moment,” said he, “for every misunderstanding
between loyal French hearts to be cleared up.
We are now brothers in the defence of our beloved
country. <span class='it'>Mon brave ami Bigourdin, donne-moi ta
main.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin sprang up,—in the public street—but
what did that matter?—and cried: “<span class='it'>Mon vieux Viriot</span>,”
and the two men embraced and kissed each other, and
every one, much affected, cried “Bravo! Bravo!” And
then Bigourdin, reaching over the marble tables, took
young Lucien Viriot’s hands and embraced him and
shook him by the shoulders, and cried: “Here is a
cuirassier who is going to cut through the Germans
like bladders of lard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a memorable reconciliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras arrived late at night, probably by the
last regular train-services; for on the next day and
for many days afterwards there were wild hurry and
crowds and confusion on roads and railways all
through France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the town poured all the men of the surrounding
villages, and the streets were filled with them and
their wives and mothers and children, and strange officers
in motor-cars whirled through the Rue de Périgueux.
Bands of young men falling into the well-remembered
step marched along the quays to the station
singing the Marseillaise, and women stood at their
doorsteps blowing them kisses as they passed. And
at the station the great military trains adorned with
branches of trees and flowers, steamed away, a massed
line of white faces and waving arms; and old men
and women young and old waved handkerchiefs until
the train disappeared, and then turned away weeping
bitterly. Martin, Fortinbras and Bigourdin went to
many a train to see off the flower of the youth of the
little town. Lucien Viriot went gallantly. “A good
war horse suits me better than an office-stool,” he
laughed. And Joseph, sloughing for ever Martin’s
shiny black raiment, went off too; and the younger
waiters of the Café de l’Univers, and Beuzot, the
young professor at the Ecole Normale, and the son of
the <span class='it'>adjoint</span>, and <span class='it'>le petit Maurin</span>, who helped his
mother at her <span class='it'>Débit de Tabac</span>. Many a familiar face
was carried away from Brantôme towards some unknown
battle-line and the thunder and the slaughter—a
familiar face which Brantôme was never to see again.
And after a day or two the town seemed futile, like
a ball-room from which the last dancers had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grave was the evening côterie at the Café de l’Univers.
The rumour had gone through France that England
more than hesitated. Fortinbras magnificently
defended England’s honour. He had been very quiet
at home, tenderly shy and wistful with Félise, unsuggestive
of paths to happiness with Martin; his attitude
towards intimate life one of gentle melancholy. He
had told Martin that he had retired from business as
<span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur</span>. He had lost the trick of it.
At Bigourdin’s urgency he had purchased an annuity
which sufficed his modest and philosophic needs. No
longer having the fierce incentive to gain the hard-earned
five-franc piece, no longer involved in a scheme
of things harmonious with an irregular profession,
he was like the singer deprived of the gift of song, the
telepathist stricken with inhibitory impotence. For
all his odd learning, for all his garnered knowledge
of the human heart, and for all his queer heroic struggle,
he stood before his own soul an irremediable failure.
So an older and almost a broken Fortinbras had
taken up his quarters at the Hôtel des Grottes. But
stimulated by the talk of war, he became once more the
orator and the seer. He held a brief for England and
his passionate sincerity imposed itself on his hearers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” said he afterwards, “I was right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the meanwhile, Martin, strung in every fibre
to high pitch by what he had heard, by what he had
seen and by what he had felt, knew that just as it was
ordained that he should come to Brantôme, so it was
ordained that he should not stay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You talk eloquently and with conviction, Monsieur,”
said the Mayor to Fortinbras—there were a
dozen in the familiar café corner, tense and eager-eyed,
and Monsieur Cazensac, the Gascon proprietor, stood
by—“but what proofs have you given us of England’s
co-operation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, with a thrill through his body, said in a
loud voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur le Maire, there is not a living Englishman
with red blood in his veins who has any doubt. I,
the most obscure of Englishmen, speak for my country.
Get me accepted as a volunteer, the humblest
foot-soldier, and I will fight for France. Take up my
pledge, Monsieur le Maire. It is the pledge of the
only Englishman in Brantôme on behalf of the British
Empire. There are millions better than I from all
ends of the earth who will be inspired by the same
sentiments of loyalty. Get me accepted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In English Martin could never have said it. Words
would have come shyly. But he was among Frenchmen,
attuned to French modes of expression. A murmur
of approbation arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” cried Martin. “I offer France my life as a
pledge for my country. Get me accepted, <span class='it'>Monsieur
le Maire</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mayor, a lean, grey-eyed, bald-headed man,
with a straggly, iron-grey beard, looked at him intently
for a few moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est bien</span>,” said he. “I take up your pledge. I
have to go to-morrow to Périgueux to see <span class='it'>Monsieur le
Préfet</span>, who has a certain friendliness for me. He has
influence with the <span class='it'>Ministère de la Guerre</span>. Accompany
me to Périgueux. I undertake to see that it is
arranged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, Monsieur le Maire,” said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then everybody talked at once, and lifted their
glasses to Martin, and Monsieur Viriot despatched
Cazensac for the sweet champagne in which nearly a
year ago they had drunk Lucien’s health; and Bigourdin
embraced him; and when the wine was poured out,
there were cries of “<span class='it'>Vive l’Angleterre!</span>” “<span class='it'>Vive la
France!</span>” “<span class='it'>Vive Martin!</span>” And the square-headed old
Monsieur Viriot set the climax of this ovation by lifting
his glass at arm’s length and proclaiming “<span class='it'>Vive
notre bon Périgordin!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said Fortinbras, who sat next to him, “I would
give the rest of my life to be as young as you, just
for the next few months. My God, you must feel
proud!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s steady English blood asserted itself: “I
don’t,” said he, “I feel a damned premature hero.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It is only in the Légion Etrangère, that fantastic,
romantic regiment of dare-devil desperadoes capable of
all iniquities and of all heroisms, that a foreigner can
enlist straight away, no questions asked. To be incorporated
in the regular army of France is another
matter. Wires have to be pulled. They were pulled
in Martin’s case. It was to his credit that he had
served two years—gaining the stripes of a corporal—in
the Rifle Corps of the University of Cambridge. At
the psychological moment of pulling, England declared
war on Germany. The resources of the British Empire,
men and money and ships and blood were on the
side of France. England and France were one. A
second’s consideration of the request of the Préfet de
la Dordogne and a hurriedly scrawled signature constituted
Martin a potential member of the French
Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened that, when the notice of authorisation
came, the first person he ran across was Félise, by the
door of the <span class='it'>fabrique</span>. He waved the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am accepted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned pale and put her hand to her heart, but
she met his eyes bravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At once—straight to Périgueux to enlist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when will you come back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he became aware of her standing scared, with
parted lips and heaving bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I hope to come back; some time or other,
when the War’s over. Naturally—but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said quaveringly—“You may be killed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So may millions. I take my chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned aside, clapped both hands to her face
and broke into a passion of weeping. Instinctively
he put an arm around her. She sobbed on his shoulder.
He whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you care so much about what happens to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tore herself away and faced him with eyes
flashing through her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think I’m a stick or a stone? I am half
English, half French. You are going to fight for
England and France. Don’t you think women feel
these things? You are a part of the Englishwoman
and the Frenchwoman that is going out to fight, and I
would hate you if you didn’t fight, but I don’t want
you to be killed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fled. And not till he left the Hôtel des
Grottes did he see her again alone. When with Bigourdin
and Fortinbras he was about to enter the old omnibus
to take him to the station, she pinned a tricolour
ribbon on his coat, and then saying “Good-bye and
God bless you,” looked him squarely in the eyes. It
was in his heart to say, “You’re worth all the Lucillas
in the universe.” But there were Bigourdin and Fortinbras
and Euphémie and Baptiste and Grégoire and
the chambermaid and a few straggling girls from the
<span class='it'>fabrique</span> all standing by. He said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you, Félise. I shall never part with your
ribbon as long as I live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grégoire climbed to his seat. Bigourdin closed the
door. The omnibus jolted and swayed down the road.
The elfin figure of Félise was suddenly cut off at the
turn. And that was the last of the Hôtel des Grottes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week or so later, Martin drilling in the hot barrack
square realised that just a year had passed since
he first set eyes on Brantôme. A year ago he had been
a spineless, aimless drudge at Margett’s Universal
College. Now, wearing a French uniform, he was
about to fight for France and England in the greatest
of all wars that the world had seen. And during
those twelve months through what soul-shaking experiences
had he not passed! Truly a wonderful year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais vous, num’ro sept! Sacré nom de Dieu!
Qu’est-ce que vous faites-là!</span>” screamed the drill sergeant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon Martin abruptly realised the intense
importance of the present moment.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>HE</span> weary weeks passed by with their alternations
of hopes and fears. Martin, insignificant
speck of blue and red, was in the Argonne.
Sergeant Bigourdin of the <span class='it'>Armée Territoriale</span> was up
in the north. The history of their days is the history
of the war which has yet to be written; the story
of their personal lives is identical with that of the personal
lives of the millions of men who have looked
and are looking Death always in the face, cut off as
it were from their own souls by the curtain of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Things went drearily at the Hôtel des Grottes. But
little manhood remained at Brantôme. Women worked
in the fields and drove the carts and kept the shops
where so few things were sold. Félise busied herself
in the <span class='it'>fabrique</span>, her staff entirely composed of
women. Fortinbras made a pretence of managing
the hotel to which for days together no travellers
came. No cars of pleasant motorists were unloaded at
its door. Now and then an elderly bagman in vain
quest of orders sat in the solitary <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>, and
Fortinbras waited on him with urbane melancholy.
Thrown intimately together father and daughter grew
nearer to each other. They became companions, walking
together on idle afternoons and sitting on mild
nights on the terrace, with the town twinkling peacefully
below them. They talked of many things. Fortinbras
drew from the rich store of his wisdom, Félise
from her fund of practical knowledge. There were
times when she forgot the harrowing mystery of her
mother, and, only conscious of a great and yearning
sympathy, unlocked her heart and cried a little in
close and comforting propinquity. Together they read
the letters from the trenches, all too short, all too elusive
in their brave cheeriness. The epistles of Martin
and Bigourdin were singularly alike. Each said
much the same. They had not the comforts of the
Hôtel des Grottes. But what would you have? War
was war. They were in splendid health. They had
enough to eat. They had had a sharp tussle with the
<span class='it'>Boches</span> and many of their men were killed. But victory
in the end was certain. In the meanwhile they
needed some warm underclothes as the nights were
growing cold; and would Félise enclose some chocolate
and packets of Bastos. Love to everybody and
<span class='it'>Vive la France!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>These letters Fortinbras would take to the Café de
l’Univers and read to the grey-headed remnant of the
coterie, each of whom had a precisely similar letter to
read. The <span class='it'>Adjoint du Maire</span> was the first to come
without a letter. He produced a telegram which was
passed from hand to hand in silence. He had come
dry-eyed and brave, but when the telegram reached
him, after completing its round, he broke down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est stupide!</span> Forgive me, my friends. I am
proud to have given my son to my country. <span class='it'>Mais
enfin</span>, he was my son—my only son. For the first
time I am glad that his mother is no longer living.”
Then he raised his head valiantly. “<span class='it'>Et toi</span>, Viriot—Lucien,
how is he doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then some one heard of the death of Beuzot, the
young professor at the Ecole Normale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, after a long interval of silence came disastrous
news of Bigourdin, lying seriously, perhaps
mortally wounded in a hospital in a little northern
town. There followed days of anguish. Telegrams
elicited the information that he had been shot through
the lung. Félise went about her work with a pinched
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In course of time a letter came from Madame Clothilde
Robineau at Chartres:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>My Dear Niece</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although your conduct towards me was ungrateful,
I am actuated by the teachings of Christianity in extending
to you my forgiveness, now that you are
alone and unprotected. I hear from a friend of the
Abbé Duloup, a venerable priest who is administering
to the wounded the consolations of religion, that
your Uncle Gaspard is condemned to death. Christian
duty and family sentiment therefore make it essential
that I should offer you a home beneath my roof. You
left it in a fit of anger because I spoke of your father
in terms of reprobation. But if you had watched by
the death-bed of your mother, my poor sister, as I
did, in the terrible garret in the Rue Maugrabine, you
would not judge me so harshly. Believe me, dear
child, I have at heart your welfare both material and
spiritual. If you desire guidance as to the conduct of
the hotel I shall be pleased to aid you with my experience.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;'>Your affectionate Aunt,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Clothilde Robineau</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The frigid offer well meant according to the woman’s
pale lights, Félise scarcely heeded. Father or
no father, uncle or no uncle, protector or no protector,
she was capable of conducting a score of hotels.
The last thing in the world she needed was the guidance
of her Aunt Clothilde. Save for one phrase in
the letter she would have written an immediate though
respectful refusal and thought nothing further of the
matter. But that one phrase flashed through her brain.
Her mother had died in the Rue Maugrabine. They
had told her she had died in hospital. Things hitherto
bafflingly dark to her became clear—on one awful,
tragic hypothesis. She shook with the terror of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the only communication the postman had
brought that late afternoon. She stood in the vestibule
to read it. Fortinbras engaged in the bureau over
some simple accounts looked up by chance and saw
her staring at the letter with great open eyes, her lips
apart, her bosom heaving. He rose swiftly, and hurrying
through the side door came to her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God! Not bad news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She handed him the letter. He read, his mind not
grasping at once that which to her was essential.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The priests are exaggerating. And as for the proposal——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Rue Maugrabine,” said Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew the quick breath of sudden realisation, and
for a long time they stood silent, looking into each
other’s eyes. At last she spoke, deadly white:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That woman I saw—who opened the door for me—was
my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had pierced to the truth. No subterfuge he
could invent had power to veil it. He made a sad
gesture of admission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you hide it from me?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had a beautiful ideal, my child, and it would
have been a crime to tear it away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held herself very erect—there was steel in the
small body—and advanced a step or so towards him,
her dark eyes fearless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what you gave me to understand when
I saw her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my child,” said Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You also were an ideal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “You loved me tenderly, but I was not
in your calendar of saints, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mastered herself, swallowing a sob, but the
tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are now,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed uncertainly. “A poor old sinner of a
saint,” he said, and gathered her to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And later, in the salon, before the fire, for the
autumn was damp and cold, he told her the cheerless
story of his life, concealing nothing, putting the
facts before her so that she could judge. She sat
on the rug, her arm about his knee. She felt very
tired, as though some part of her had bled to death.
But a new wonder filled her heart. In a way she had
been prepared for the discovery. In her talks with
her uncle and with Martin she had been keen to mark
a strange disingenuousness. She had accused them
of conspiracy. They were concealing something; what,
she knew not; but a cloud had rested on her mother’s
memory. If, on that disastrous evening, the frowsy
woman of the Rue Maugrabine had revealed herself
as her mother, her soul would have received a shock
from which recovery might have been difficult. Now
the shock had not only been mitigated by months of
torturing doubt, but was compensated by the thrill of
her father’s sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had ended, she turned and wept and knelt
before him, crying for forgiveness, calling him all
manner of foolish names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said, stroking her dark hair: “I am only a poor
old bankrupt <span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be <span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur</span> to the end,”
she said, and with total want of logical relevance she
added: “See what happiness you have brought me
to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate, my dear,” said he, “we have found
each other at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to bed and lay awake till dawn looking at
a new world of wrong doing, suffering and heroism.
Who was she, humble little girl, living her sequestered
life, to judge men by the superficialities of their known
actions? She had judged her father almost to the
catastrophe of love. She had judged Martin bitterly.
What did she know of the riot in his soul? Now he
was offering his life for a splendid ideal. She felt
humble beside her conception of him. And her Uncle
Gaspard, great, tender, adored, was lying far, far
away in the north, with a bullet through his body.
She prayed her valiant little soul out for the two of
them. And the next morning she arose and went to
her work brave and clear-eyed, with a new hope in
God based upon a new faith in man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A day or two later she received a wild letter from
Corinna Hastings. Corinna’s letters were as frequent
as blackberries in March. Félise knitted her brows
over it for a long time. Then she took it to her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sense,” she said, “must lie in the scrabble I
can’t make out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortinbras put on his spectacles and when, not
without difficulty, he had deciphered it, he took off the
spectacles and smiled the benevolent smile of the
<span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it to me, my dear,” said he. “I will answer
Corinna.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>In the tiny town of Wendlebury, in the noisy bosom
of her family, Corinna was eating her heart out. During
the latter days of June she had returned to the
fold, an impecunious failure. As a matter of theory
she had upheld the principles of woman suffrage. As
a matter of practice, in the effort to obtain it, she
loathed it with bitter hatred. She lacked the inspiration
of its overwhelming importance in sublunary affairs.
She was willing enough to do ordinary work
in its interests, at a living wage, even to the odious
extent of wearing an anæmic tricolor and selling newspapers
in the streets. But when her duties involved incendiarism,
imprisonment and hunger, striking, Corinna
revolted. She had neither the conviction nor
the courage. Miss Banditch reviled her for a recreant,
a snake in the grass and a spineless doll and left the
flat, forswearing her acquaintance for ever. Headquarters
signified disapproval of her pusillanimity.
Driven to desperation she signified her disapproval of
Headquarters in unmeasured terms. The end came
and prospective starvation drove her home to Wendlebury.
When the war broke out, in common with the
rest of the young maidenhood of the town, she yearned
to do something to help the British Empire. Her sister
Clara, to satisfy this laudable craving, promptly
married a subaltern, and, when he was ordered to the
front, went to live with his people. The next youngest
sister, Evelyn, anxious for Red Cross work, found herself
subsidised by an aunt notoriously inimical to Corinna.
Corinna therefore had to throw in her lot
with Margaret and Winnie, chits of fifteen and thirteen—the
intervening boys having flown from the nest.
What was a penniless and, in practical matters, a feckless
young woman to do? She knitted socks and mufflers
and went round the town collecting money for
Belgian refugees. So did a score of tabbies, objects
of Corinna’s scornful raillery who district-visited the
poor to exasperation. She demanded work more glorious,
more heroic; but lack of funds tied her to detested
knitting-needles. As the Vicar’s daughter she
was compelled to go to church and listen to her father’s
sermons on the war; compared with which infliction,
she tartly informed her mother, forcible feeding
was a gay amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once or twice she had a postcard from Martin in
the Argonne. She cursed herself, her destiny and her
sex. If only she was a man she would at least have
gone forth with a gun on her shoulder. But she was
a woman; the most helpless thing in women God
ever made. Even her mother, whom she had rated
low on account of intellectual short-comings, she began
to envy. At any rate she had generously performed
her woman’s duty. She had brought forth ten children,
five men children, two of whom had rushed to
take up arms in defence of their country. Martin’s
last postcard had told Corinna of Bigourdin being
called away to fight. In her enforced isolation from
the great events of the great world she became acutely
conscious that in all the great world only one individual
had ever found a use for her. A flash of such
knowledge either scorches or illuminates the soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then early in November she received a misspelt
letter laboriously written in hard pencil on thin, glazed
paper. It was addressed from a hospital in the North
of France.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Mademoiselle Corinna</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have done my best to strike a blow for my beloved
country. It was written that I should do so, and it
was written perhaps that I should give my life for her.
I am dictating these words to my bedside neighbour
who is wounded in the knee. For my part, a German
bullet has penetrated my lung, and the doctors say I
may not live. But while I still can speak, I am anxious
to tell you that on the battlefield your image has
always been before my eyes and that I always have in
my heart a love for you tender and devoted. Should
I live, Mademoiselle, I pray you to forget this letter,
as I do not wish to cause you pain. But should I
die, let me now have the consolation of believing that
I shall have a place in your thoughts as one who has
died, not unworthily or unwillingly, in a noble cause.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Gaspard-Marie Bigourdin</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna sat for a long time, frozen to her soul, looking
out of her bedroom window at the hopeless autumn
drizzle, and the sodden leaves on the paths of the
vicarage garden. Then, with quivering lips, she sat
down at the rickety little desk that had been hers since
childhood and wrote to Bigourdin. She sealed it and
went out in the rain and dropped it in the nearest
pillar box. When she reached her room again, the
realisation of the inadequacy of her words smote her.
She threw herself on her bed and sobbed. After
which she wrote her wild letter to Félise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the next few days a chastened Corinna went
about the Vicarage. An unusual gentleness manifested
itself in her demeanour, and at last emboldened
Mrs. Hastings, good, kind soul, to take the unprecedented
step of enquiring into her wayward and sharp-tongued
daughter’s private affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid, dearie, that letter you had from France
contained bad news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mother,” said Corinna, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were alone in the drawing room. Mrs. Hastings
laid aside her knitting, rose slowly—she was a
portly woman—and went across to Corinna and put
her arm about her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you tell me what it was, dearie?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna melted to the voice. It awakened memories
of unutterable comfort of childish years. She surrendered
to the embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mother. The truest man I have ever known—a
Frenchman—is dying over there. He asked me
to marry him a year ago. And I was a fool, mother.
Oh! an awful fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And half an hour later, she said tearfully: “I’ve
been a fool in so many ways. I’ve misjudged you so,
mother. It never occurred to me that you would understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said Mrs. Hastings, stroking her hair,
“to bring ten children into the world and keep them
going on small means, to say nothing of looking after
a husband, isn’t a bad education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day came a telegram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Re letter Félise. If you want to find yourself at
last go straight to Bigourdin. Fortinbras.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The message was a lash. She had not contemplated
the possibility of going to France. In the sleepless
nights she had ached to be with him. But how? In
Tierra del Fuego he would be equally inaccessible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go straight to him.” The words were very simple.
Of course she would go. Why had she waited
for Fortinbras to point out her duty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the humiliating knowledge of impotence.
She looked in her purse and counted out her fortune
of thirteen shillings and sevenpence halfpenny. A
very humble Corinna showed letter and telegram to her
mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The war seems to have turned everything upside
down,” said the latter. “You ought to go, dear. It’s
a sacred duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can I? I have no money. I can’t ask
father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come upstairs,” said Mrs. Hastings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led the way to her bedroom and from a locked
drawer took an old-fashioned japanned despatch-box,
which she opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All my married life,” she said, “I have managed
to keep something against a rainy day. Take what
you want, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus came the overthrowal of all Corinna’s scheme
of values. She went to France, a woman with a warm
and throbbing heart.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIV</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>T</span> was with difficulty that she reached the little
French town, and it was with infinitely more difficulty
that she overcame military obstacles and
penetrated into the poor little whitewashed school that
did duty as a hospital. It was a great bare room
with a double row of iron bedsteads, a gangway between
them. Here and there an ominous screen shut
off a bed. A few bandaged men half dressed were
sitting up smoking and playing cards. An odour of
disinfectant caught her by the throat. A human form
lying by the door with but little face visible, was
moaning piteously. She shrank on the threshold,
aghast at this abode of mangled men. The young
<span class='it'>aide-major</span> escorting her, pointed up the ward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find him there, Mademoiselle, Number
Seventeen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is he?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day before yesterday he nearly went,” he
snapped his finger and thumb. “A hemorrhage which
we stopped. But the old French stock is solid as oak,
Mademoiselle. A hole or two doesn’t matter. He is
going along pretty well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A nurse with red-cross badge met them. “Ah, it
is the lady for Sergeant Bigourdin. He has been expecting
you ever since your letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes were all of him that she recognised at first.
His great, hearty face had grown hollow and the lower
part was concealed by a thick, black beard. She remembered
having heard of <span class='it'>les poilus</span>, the hairy-ones,
as the Territorial Troops were affectionately termed
in France. But his kind, dark eyes were full
of gladness. The nurse set a stool for Corinna by
the bedside. On her left lay another black-bearded
man who looked at her wistfully. He had been Bigourdin’s
amanuensis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This angel of tyranny forbids me to move my
arms,” whispered Bigourdin apologetically. The little
whimsical phrase struck the note of the man’s unconquerable
spirit. Corinna smiled through tears. The
nurse said: “Talk to him and don’t let him talk to
you. You can only have ten minutes.” She retired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Cela vous fait beaucoup souffrir, mon pauvre ami?</span>”
said Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “Not now that you are here.
It is wonderful of you to come. You have a heart of
gold. And it is that little talisman, <span class='it'>ce petit cœur d’or</span>,
that is going to make me well. You cannot imagine—it
is like a fairy tale to see you here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instinctively Corinna put out her hand and touched
his lips. She had never done so feminine and tender
a thing to a man. She let her fingers remain, while
he kissed them. She flushed and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t talk. It is for me who have sound
lungs. I have come because I have been a little imbecile,
and only at the eleventh hour I have repented
of my folly. If I had been sensible a year ago, this
would not have happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned happy eyes on her; but he said with his
Frenchman’s clear logic:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All my love and all the happiness that might have
been would not have altered the destinies of Europe.
I should have been brought here, all the same, with
a ridiculous little hole through my great body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corinna admitted the truth of his statement. “But,”
said she, “I might have been of some comfort to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyebrows expressed the shrug of which his
maimed frame was incapable. “It is all for the best.
If I had left you at Brantôme, my heart would have
been torn in two. I might have been cautious to the
detriment of France. As it was, I didn’t care much
what happened to me. And now they have awarded me
the <span class='it'>médaille militaire</span>; and you are here, to make, as
Baudelaire says, ‘<span class='it'>ma joie et ma santé</span>.’ What more
can a man desire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now all this bravery was spoken in a voice so weak
that the woman in Corinna was stirred to its depths.
She bent over him and whispered—for she knew that
the man with the wistful gaze in the next bed was listening:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est vrai que tu m’aimes toujours?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw her question answered by the quick illumination
of his eyes, and she went on quickly: “And
I, I love you too, and I will give you all my poor life
for what it is worth. Oh!” she cried, “I can’t imagine
what you can see in me. Beside you I feel so small,
of so little account. I can do nothing—nothing but
love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s everything in the world,” said Bigourdin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were silent for a moment. Then he said: “I
should like to meet the <span class='it'>Boche</span> who fired that rifle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So should I,” she cried fiercely. “I should like to
tear him limb from limb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t,” said Bigourdin. “I should like to
decorate him with a pair of wings and a little bow
and arrow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurse came up. “You must go now, mademoiselle.
The patient is becoming too excited. It is not
your fault. Nothing but a bolster across their mouths
will prevent these Périgordins from talking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tiny bedroom in a house over a grocer’s shop was
all the accommodation that she had been able to secure,
as the town was full of troops billeted on the
inhabitants. As it was, that bedroom had been given
up to her by a young officer who took pity on her
distress. She felt her presence impertinent in this
stern atmosphere of war. After seeing Bigourdin,
she wandered for a while about the rainy streets and
then retired to her chilly and comfortless room, where
she ate her meal of sardines and sausage. The next
day she presented herself at the hospital and saw the
<span class='it'>aide-major</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you give me some work to do?” she asked. “I
don’t pretend to be able to nurse. But I could fetch
and carry and do odd jobs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was a French hospital, and the <span class='it'>règlement</span>
made no provision for affording prepossessing young
Englishwomen romantic employment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, said the <span class='it'>aide-major</span>, if Mademoiselle was
bent upon it, she could write an application which
would be forwarded to the proper quarter. But it
would have to pass through the <span class='it'>bureaux</span>—and she,
who knew France so well, was aware what the passing
through the <span class='it'>bureaux</span> meant. Unless she had the ear
of high personages, it would take weeks and perhaps
months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in the meantime,” said Corinna, “my <span class='it'>grand
ami</span>, Number 17 down there, will have got well and
departed from the hospital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle,” said he, “you have already saved
the life of one gallant Frenchman. Don’t you think
that should give you a sentiment of duty accomplished?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She blushed. He was kind. For he was young and
she was pretty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can let you see your <span class='it'>gros heureux</span> to-day,” said
he. “It is a favour. It is against the <span class='it'>règlement</span>. If
the <span class='it'>major</span> hears of it, there will be trouble. By the
grace of God he has a bilious attack which confines
him to his quarters. But, <span class='it'>bien entendu</span>, it is for this
time only.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thanked him and again found herself by Bigourdin’s
bedside. The moment of her first sight of
him was the happiest in her life. She had wrought a
miracle. He was a different man inspired with the
supreme will to live. The young doctor had spoken
truly. A spasm of joy shook her. At last she had
been of some use in the world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She saw too the
Bigourdin whom she had known. His great, black
beard had vanished. One of the <span class='it'>camarades</span>, with two
disposable arms, had hunted through the kits of the patients
for a razor and had shaved him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tell me I am getting on magnificently,” said
he. “This morning there is no longer any danger. In
a few months I shall be as solid as ever I was. It is
happiness that has cured me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked. She told him of her conversation with
the <span class='it'>aide-major</span>. He reflected for a moment. Then he
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you wish to please me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I here for?” asked Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are here to spoil me. Anyhow—if you wish
to please me, go to Brantôme, and await me. To know
that you are there, <span class='it'>chez-moi</span>, will give me the courage
of a thousand lions, and you will be able to console
my poor Félise who every night is praying for Martin
by the side of her little white bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was arranged. After two days extraordinary
travel, advancing from point to point by any
train that happened to run, shunted on sidings for interminable
periods, in order to allow the unimpeded
progress of military trains, waiting weary hours at
night in cold, desolate stations, hungry and broken,
but her heart aglow with a new and wonderful happiness,
she reached Brantôme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw her arms round the neck of an astonished,
but ever urbane elderly gentleman in the vestibule of
the Hôtel des Grottes and kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s getting well,” she cried a little hysterically.
“He sent me here to wait for him. I’m so happy and
I’m just about dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But yet there’s that spark of life in you, my dear
Corinna,” said Fortinbras, “which, according to the
saying, distinctly justifies hope. Félise and I will see
to it that you live.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was winter before Bigourdin was well enough to
return. By that time Corinna had settled down to her
new life wherein she found the making of <span class='it'>foie gras</span>
an enticing mystery. Also, in a town where every
woman had her man—husband, brother, son or lover—either
in hourly peril of death, or dead or wounded,
there was infinite scope for help and consolation. And
when a woman said: “<span class='it'>Hélas! Mon pauvre homme.
Il est blessé là-bas</span>,” she could reply with a new, thrilling
sympathy and a poignant throb of the heart: “And
my man too.” For like all the other women there, she
had “<span class='it'>son homme</span>.” Her man! Corinna tasted the
fierce joy of being elemental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was much distress in the little town. The
municipality did its best. In many cases the wives
valiantly carried on the husband’s business. But in
the row of cave dwellings where the quarrymen lived
no muscular arms hewed the week’s wages from the
rocks. Boucabeille, Martin’s Bacchanalian friend, had
purged all his offences in heroic battle, and was lying
in an unknown grave. Corinna, learning how Martin
had carried the child home on his shoulders, brought
her to the hotel and cared for her, and obtained work
for the mother in the <span class='it'>fabrique</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never before had Corinna had days so full; never
before had she awakened in the morning with love in
her heart. Félise, grown gentler and happier since
the canonisation of her father, gave her unstinted affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Bigourdin arrived, nominally on sick-leave,
but with private intimation that his active
services would be required no longer. This gave
a touch of sadness to his otherwise joyous home-coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not killed half enough Boches,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after his return came a letter from
Martin. And it was written from a hospital.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>My Dearest Félise</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am well and sound and in perfect health. But a
bullet got me in the left arm while we were attacking
a German trench, and a spent bit of shrapnel caught
me on the head and stunned me. When I recovered
I was midway between the trenches in the zone of fire
and I had to lie still between the dead bodies of two
of our brave soldiers. I thought much, my dear,
while I was lying there expecting every minute a
bullet to finish me. And some of what I thought I
will tell you, when I see you, for I shall see you very
soon. After some thirty-six hours I was collected and
brought to the field hospital, where I was patched up,
and in the course of a day or so sent on to the base.
I lay on straw during the journey in a row of other
wounded. France has the defects of her qualities.
Her soil is so fertile that her stalks of straw are like
young oak saplings. When I arrived I had such a
temperature and was so silly with pain that I don’t
very well remember what happened. When I got
sensible they told me that gangrene had set in and
that they had chopped off my arm above the elbow.
I always thought I was an incomplete human being,
dear, but I have never been so idiotically incomplete
as I am now. Although I am getting along splendidly
I want to do all sorts of things with the fingers that
aren’t there. I turn to pick up something and there’s
nothing to pick it up with. A week before I was
wounded, I had a finger nail torn off, and it still hurts
me, somewhere in space, about a foot away from what
is <span class='it'>me</span>. You would laugh if you knew what a nuisance
it is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I make no excuses for asking you to receive
me at Brantôme; all that is dear to me in the
world is there—and what other spot in the wide universe
have I to fly to?</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>sacré nom d’une pipe</span>!” cried Bigourdin—for
Félise, after private and tearful perusal of the letter,
was reading such parts of it aloud as were essential
for family information—“What is the imbecile talking
of? Where else, indeed, should he go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise continued. Martin as yet unaware of Bigourdin’s
return, sent him messages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you write, will you tell him I have given
to France as much of myself as I’ve been allowed to?
Half an arm isn’t much. <span class='it'>Mais c’est déjà quelque
chose.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Quelque chose!</span>” cried Bigourdin. “But it is a
sacred sacrifice. If I could get hold of that little bit
of courageous arm I would give it to Monsieur le Curé
and bid him nail it up as an object venerable and
heroic in his parish church. <span class='it'>Ah! le pauvre garçon, le
pauvre garçon</span>,” said he. “<span class='it'>Mais voyez-vous</span>, it is the
English character that comes out in his letter. I have
seen many English up there in the North. No longer
can we Frenchmen talk of <span class='it'>le phlègme britannique</span>. The
astounding revelation is the unconquerable English
gaiety. <span class='it'>Jamais de longs visages.</span> If a decapitated
English head could speak, it would launch you a whimsical
smile and say: “What annoys me is that I can’t
inhale a cigarette.” And here our good Martin makes
a joke about the straw in the ambulance-train. <span class='it'>Mon
Dieu!</span> I know what it is, but it has never occurred to
me to jest about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of time Martin returned to Brantôme.
The railway system of the country had been
fairly adjusted in the parts of France that were distant
from scenes of military operations. Bigourdin borrowed
Monsieur le Maire’s big limousine which had
not been commandeered—for the Mayor was on many
committees in the Department and had to fly about
from place to place and with Corinna and Félise and
Fortinbras he met Martin’s train at Périgueux. As
it steamed in a hand waved from a window below a
familiar face. They rushed to the carriage steps and
in a moment he was among them—in a woollen Kepi
and incredibly torn blue-grey greatcoat and ragged red
trousers, the unfilled arm of the coat dangling down
idly. But it was a bronzed, clear-eyed man who met
them, for all his war battering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bigourdin welcomed him first, in his exuberant way,
called him <span class='it'>mon brave, mon petit héros</span>, and hugged
him. Fortinbras gripped his hand, after the English
manner. Corinna, happy and smiling through glistening
eyes, he kissed without more ado. And then he
was free to greet Félise, who had remained a pace
or two in the background. Her great, dark eyes were
fixed upon him questioningly. She put out a hand
and touched the empty sleeve. She read in his face
what she had never read before. His one poor arm,
stretched in an instinctive curve—with a little sobbing
cry she threw herself blindly into his embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tremendous issues of existence with which for
five months he had been grappling had wiped out from
his consciousness, almost from his memory, the first
enthralling kiss of another woman. Caked with mud,
deafened by the roar of shells, sleeping in the earth of
his trench, an intimate of blood and death day after
day, he had learned that Lucilla had been but an <span class='it'>ignis
fatuus</span> leading him astray from the essential meaning
of his life. He knew, as he lay wounded beneath the
hell of machine-gun fire between the trenches that
there was only one sweet, steadfast soul in the world
who called him to the accomplishment of his being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, in the abandonment of her joy and grief his
lips met the soft, quivering mouth of Félise, care, like
a garment, fell from him. He whispered: “You
have a great heart. I’ve not deserved this. But you’re
the only thing that matters to me in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Félise was content. She knew that the war had
swept his soul clean of false gods. Out of that furnace
nothing but Truth could come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so Martin returned for ever to the land of his
adoption, which on the morrow was to take him after
its generous and expansive way as a hero to its bosom.
The Englishman who had given a limb for Périgord
was to be held in high honour for the rest of his
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a man now who had passed through most
human experiences. A man of fine honour, of courage
tested in a thousand ways, of stiffened will, of high
ideals. The life that lay before him was far dearer
than any other he could have chosen. For it matters
not so much the life one leads as the knowledge of the
perfect way to live it. And that knowledge, based
on wisdom, had Martin achieved. He knew that if
the glittering prizes of the earth are locked away behind
golden bars opening but to golden keys, there
are others far more precious lying to the hand of him
who will but seek them in the folds of the familiar
hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The five sat down to dinner that evening in the
empty <span class='it'>salle-à-manger</span>; for not a guest, even the most
decrepit commercial traveller, was staying at the hotel.
Yet never had they met at a happier meal. Félise cut
up Martin’s food as though it had been blessed bread.
In the middle of it Fortinbras poured out half a glass
of wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My children,” said he, “I am going to break
through the habit of years. This old wine of Burgundy
is too generous to betray me on an occasion so
beautiful and so solemn. I drink to your happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But to whom do Martin and I owe our happiness?”
cried Corinna, with a flush on her cheek, and a glistening
in her blue eyes. “It is to you—from the first to
last to you, <span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God! Yes,” said Martin, extending his one
arm to Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ex-Dealer in Happiness regarded them both
benevolently. “For the first time in my life,” said
he, “I think I have reason to be proud of my late
profession. Like the artist who has toiled and struggled,
I can, without immodesty, recognise my masterpiece.
It was my original conception that Martin and
Corinna, crude but honest souls, should find an incentive
to the working out of their destiny by falling
in love. Therefore I sent them out together. That
they should have an honourable asylum, I sent them
to my own kin. When I found they wouldn’t fall in
love at all, I imagined the present felicitous combination.
I have been aided by the little accident of a
European war. But what matter? The Gods willed
it, the Gods were on my side. Out of evil there inscrutably
and divinely cometh good. My children, my
heart is very full of the consolation that, at the end of
many years that the locust hath eaten, I have perhaps
justified my existence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon père</span>,” cried Félise, “all my life long your existence
has had the justification of heroic sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said he, “if I hadn’t met adversity with
a brave face, I should not have been a man—still
less a philosopher. And now that my duty here is
over, if I don’t go back to Paris and find some means
of helping in the great conflict, I shall be unworthy of
the name of Englishman. So as soon as I see you
safely and exquisitely married, I shall leave you. I
shall, however, come and visit you from time to time.
But when I die”—he paused and fishing out a stump
of pencil scribbled on the back of the menu card—“when
I die, bury me in Paris on the south side of
the Seine and put this inscription on my tombstone.
One little vanity is accorded by the gods to every human
being.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw the card on the table. On it was written:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Marchand de Bonheur.</span>”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>When the meal was over they went up to the prim
and plushily furnished salon, where a wood fire was
burning gaily. Bigourdin brought up a cobwebbed
bottle of the Old Brandy of the Brigadier and uncorked
it reverently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are going to drink to France,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He produced from the cupboard whose doors were
veiled with green-pleated silk, half a dozen of the great
glass goblets and into each he poured a little of the
golden liquid, which, as he had once said, contained
the soul of the <span class='it'>Grande Armée</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop a bit,” said Martin. “You’re making a mistake.
There are only five of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am making no mistake at all,” said Bigourdin.
“The sixth glass is for the shade of the brave old
Brigadier. If he is not here now among us to honour
the toast, I am no Christian man.”</p>
